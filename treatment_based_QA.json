According to 2013 European League Against Rheumatism(EULAR) recommendations for the non-pharmacological core management of hip and knee osteoarthritis.\n\n Education on weight loss should incorporate individualised strategies that are recognised to effect successful weight loss\nand maintenance*—for example: \na† regular self-monitoring, recording monthly weight\nb† regular support meetings to review\/discuss progress\nc† increase physical activity\nd† follow a structured meal plan that starts with breakfast\ne† reduce fat (especially saturated) intake; reduce sugar; limit salt; increase intake of fruit and vegetables (at least ‘5\nportions’ a day)\nf† limit portion size;\ng† addressing eating behaviours and triggers to eating (eg, stress)\nh† nutrition education\ni† relapse prediction and management (eg, with alternative coping strategies)\nThe recommendation is mainly supported by the literature in knee OA, as no evidence to support the effect of weight loss in patients with hip OA is available. However, being overweight or obese has been shown to be associated with hip OA (OR=1.11, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.16). In patients with knee OA, the effectiveness of weight-loss programmes on body weight, pain and\/or physical function was demonstrated in programmes delivered as weekly super vised sessions for a range of 8 weeks to 2 years. The effects on pain, function and weight loss from attending weight-loss programmes were small but significant (ES, 95%\nCI, pain 0.20, 0.00 to 0.39; physical function 0.23, 0.04 to 0.42; mean weight loss, 95% CI, 6.1 kg, 4.7 to 7.6).109 The interventions included strategies on how to reduce calorie intake by meal plans, reduce fat and sugar, reduce portion size, meal replacements, and comprised behavioural modifications, selfmonitoring, weight-loss goals and maintaining body weight in participants who had reached their goals and\/or exercises for some of them. Overall, the evidence from RCTs for the maintenance of achieved weight loss after the interventions have ended is absent in people with hip and knee OA. In general, in overweight or obese populations, healthy eating, limiting fat and salt intake, eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, being physically active for at least 30 min\/ day and elements such as self-monitoring, explicit weight-loss goals, and motivational interviewing have all been suggested to promote weight loss and that regular follow-up over 4 years helps in maintenance of the weight loss. Weight-loss programmes in older obese people that included explicit weight-loss goals showed mean changes in weight of −4.0 kg (95% CI −7.3 to −0.7), which was significantly more than pro grammes without explicit weight-loss goals (mean change, 95% CI, −1.3 kg, −2.9 to 0.3).65 To achieve a structured meal plan with a balanced combinations of low calorie and sufficient vitamin and mineral intake, meal replacement bars or powders can be an addition to healthy eating. Though not included in the literature review, it has been suggested that bariatric surgery should be part of comprehensive weight management in people with hip or knee OA who are morbidly obese, and could help reduce weight and joint pain.","RecommendationStatus":"Recommend","StrengthofRecommendation":"Not specified","CertaintyofEvidence":"hip III \/Knee Ia"},{"Guideline specific question":"Is intra-articular corticosteroids (IACS) and intra-articular hyaluronan (IAHA) recommended for Pharmacologic Treatment of osteoarthritis.","Short_answer":"intra-articular corticosteroids (IACS) and intra-articular hyaluronan (IAHA) is Recommend for Knee osteoarthritis PharmacologicTreatment.

While the “true” magnitude of effect is difficult to discern, the risk of harm is minor, resulting in the Voting Panel providing a conditional recommendation.\n    Although a large number of trials have addressed the use of acupuncture for OA, its efficacy remains a subject of controversy.\n\n    Acupuncture is Not recommended for  osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment. The strength of recommendation is Not specified The certainty of evidence is Not specified. According to 2022 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for osteoarthritis in over 16s: diagnosis and management.\n    The available evidence was predominantly for knee osteoarthritis. This showed a lack of benefits of acupuncture and some evidence of harm. Economic evidence also showed that using acupuncture for osteoarthritis is not cost effective, so the committee did not recommend using acupuncture or dry needling. There was some evidence of clinical benefit and cost effectiveness for electroacupuncture but this was of very low quality because of small study sizes and inconsistency between studies. The evidence for electroacupuncture suggested it showed a benefit compared with sham acupuncture but not compared with acupuncture or no treatment. The committee considered that the inconsistent evidence could be the result of some people responding more to electroacupuncture than others. Because there is uncertainty about who might benefit from electroacupuncture, the committee made a recommendation for research on electroacupuncture for osteoarthritis.\nAcupuncture is may be used for knee osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment. The strength of recommendation is limited The certainty of evidence is Not specified. According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)\n    A meta-analysis was performed using pain data from five high-quality studies (Chen 2013, Suarez-Almazor 2010, Mavrommatis 2012, Berman 2004, Hinman 2014) and two moderate-quality studies (Vas 2007, Berman 1999). Acupuncture treatments were either traditional (Chen 2013, Hinman 2014) or electro-acupuncture (Suarez-Almazor 2010, Mavrommatis 2012, Vas 2007, Berman 2004, Berman 1999). Control groups consisted of either no acupuncture (Hinman 2014), sham acupuncture (Mavrommatis 2012, Suarez-Almazor 2010, Vas 2007, Berman 2004), sham TENS (Chen 2013), or usual care (Berman 1999). The meta-analysis also accounted for the degree of blinding effectiveness of the studies. The results of the meta-analysis can be seen in Figure 11 in the appendix. The overall findings were in favor of acupuncture for reducing pain in subjects with knee osteoarthritis. There appeared to be no effect in two studies where blinding was effective. In studies where there was no blinding or the effects of blinding were unclear, there were greater effects favoring acupuncture. This prompted our decision to apply a limited strength of recommendation in favor of acupuncture for pain control.\n    A similar meta-analysis was performed using the same studies for measures of function. The results of this meta-analysis can be seen in Figure 12 in the appendix. The overall findings were in favor of acupuncture for improving measures of function in subjects with knee osteoarthritis. However, the effects of blinding effectiveness on the results were similar to that described above for pain. Again, this prompted our decision to apply a limited strength of recommendation in favor of acupuncture for improving function.\nSome investigators examined variations in the delivery of acupuncture treatment. Ju et al. examined high intensity vs. low intensity electro-acupuncture and found no difference between these approaches for pain but possibly better improvements in function favoring the high-intensity group (Ju 2015). Others found no meaningful differences between using 2-point, 4-point, or 6-point acupuncture approaches (Qi 2016, Taechaarpornkul 2009).\n    The Acupuncture recommendation has been downgraded two levels because of inconsistent evidence and a lack of internal consistency with recommendations of equal supporting evidence.acupuncture (ie traditional, laser, electrical) is Not Recommend for Knee osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment.

This included information about the causes, what their diagnosis means for the future and where to find more information on self-management. The committee based their recommendations on the evidence and their experience. They agreed that it is important to tell people that diagnosis is made clinically without imaging, that imaging rarely provides any extra information helpful for diagnosing or planning non-surgical treatment for osteoarthritis, and that it would only be used if there were suspicion of an alternative diagnosis or other complications. This would help reassure and dispel any belief that X-rays or other forms of imaging are needed to diagnose osteoarthritis. \n\nThe committee noted the importance of information that offers hope for the future and supports self-management strategies (for example, information that emphasises symptom-reducing behaviours, like therapeutic exercise). They agreed that explaining the core treatments for osteoarthritis would help people understand that pharmacological treatments are not a long-term solution. They also agreed that information about recognising flares and how to manage changes in pain would help the person better understand how their condition may vary over time and what they can do about it. The committee noted more evidence was needed on information about managing flares and information for different populations of people with osteoarthritis, and so made recommendations for research on what information people with osteoarthritis need. \n\nThe committee agreed that each person's experience of osteoarthritis differs and therefore tailoring the information to their needs, as described in NICE's guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services, is important. They also agreed that osteoarthritis is more common in older people who are likely to have other conditions.

It is critical for normal development of sympathetic and sensory neurons that are responsible for nociception and temperature sensation.110 A humanised monoclonal antibody, tanezumab, was developed specifically to inhibit NGF from binding to its receptors on pain-signalling neurons.

The strength of recommendation is Moderate The certainty of evidence is Not specified. According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)\n\nThe three studies discussed below compare outcomes following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy with physical therapy and demonstrate that knee arthroscopy with partial meniscectomy is as effective as physical therapy. In PICO 5, this workgroup recommended supervised or unsupervised exercise as opposed to no exercise to improve pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Currently, there are no studies that compare outcomes (knee pain and function) following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy versus physical therapy alone in patients who have failed to improve with an initial course of physical therapy. It is important to clearly define the appropriate indications for arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in patients with knee OA. This procedure should be considered in patients with mild-to-moderate knee OA and an MRI-confirmed meniscal tear who have previously failed appropriate conservative treatment such as physical therapy, corticosteroid injections, and a course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.\n\nKatz et al (2013) conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of symptomatic patients over the age 45 or older with a meniscal tear and evidence of mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis to determine the efficacy of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy compared to standardized physical therapy in this patient population. Three hundred fifty-one patients were randomly assigned to surgery and postoperative physical therapy or to a standardized physical therapy regimen (with the option to cross over to surgery at the discretion of the patient and surgeon). The patients were evaluated at 6 and 12 months, and the primary outcome was the difference between the groups with respect to the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) physical function score. The mean improvement in WOMAC score at 6 months was similar between the groups. At 6 months, 51 patients who were randomized to physical therapy alone (30%) had undergone surgery. The authors concluded that in their intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences in functional improvement 6 months after randomization; however, 30% of patients in the physical therapy alone group underwent surgery. These patients were analyzed in their original group, based on the intention-to-treat analysis.\n\nVan de Graaf et al. (2018) performed a multicenter randomized clinical trial in the Netherlands to determine whether physical therapy is inferior to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) for improving patient-reported knee function in patients with meniscal tears. Three hundred twenty-one patients were randomly assigned to APM or a predefined physical therapy protocol. Patients were excluded if they had locking of the knee, prior knee surgery, instability caused by anterior or posterior cruciate ligament rupture, severe osteoarthritis (Kellgren Lawrence score of 4), and a BMI > 35 kg\/m2. Change in patient-reported knee function on the International Knee Documentation Committee Subscale Knee form (IKDC) over a 24-month period was used as the primary outcome. In the PT group, 47 patients (29%) had APM during the 24-month follow-up period. The authors noted a similar level of improvement in knee function between the APM and PT groups. They concluded that PT was noninferior to APM for improving patient-reported knee function over a 24-month follow-up period in patients with nonobstructive meniscal tears.\n\nIn 2007, Herrlin et al. performed a prospective randomized study to compare knee function and physical activity following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy followed by supervised exercise or supervised exercise alone in patients with non-traumatic medial meniscal tear. Ninety patients were evaluated using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS), the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, and Tegner Activity Scale and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain prior to the intervention and after 8 weeks of exercise and 6 months following intervention. The authors found that after the intervention, both groups reported decreased knee pain, improved knee function, and high satisfaction (p < 0.0001). They, therefore, concluded that arthroscopic partial meniscectomy was not superior to supervised exercise alone in terms of reduced knee pain, improved knee function, and improved quality of life.\nArthroscopy with lavage and\/or debridement is Not Recommend for knee osteoarthritis SurgeryTreatment.

According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)\nArthroscopy with lavage and\/or debridement only for treating knee osteoarthritis is not recommended.\nThere were four studies that met the inclusion criteria for this recommendation. There was one high strength (Moseley et al 2002), two moderate strength (Kirkley et al. 2008, Kalunian et al. 2000), and one low quality (Saeed et al. 2015).\n\nKirkely et al. 2008 compared arthroscopic surgery which included lavage and debridement combined with physical therapy and medical treatment versus physical therapy and medical treatment alone. The outcome measures utilized were the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, Short Form-36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary score, McMaster– Toronto Arthritis Patient Preference Disability Questionnaire (MACTAR), and the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) and standard-gamble utility scores. Six patients assigned to surgery elected not to have the procedure; data from these patients were analyzed, according to the intention to- treat principle, with data from the surgery group. Out of all potential outcomes, only two were statistically significant in favor of surgery. In summary, this randomized controlled trial demonstrated no benefit of arthroscopic lavage and debridement compared to physical therapy and medical treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\nKalunian et al. 2000 compared arthroscopic lavage (3000ml) with placebo (250ml). The study was performed at 4 different institutes and included a large number of enrolled patients from one institution with intra-articular crystals in their knee. The arthroscopes used were less than usual caliber in size ranging from 1.7mm to 2.7mm. Outcome measures were WOMAC scores at 12 months. There were not any statistically significant differences in aggregate WOMAC scores between the two treatment groups. The study concludes that irrigation may be helpful in a small subset of patients, especially those with crystals.\n\nMosley et al. 2002 study is an RCT comparing arthroscopic debridement, arthroscopic lavage, versus placebo \/ sham surgery. The study provides strong evidence that knee arthroscopy with or without debridement is not better and appears to be equivalent to a placebo procedure in improving knee pain and self-reported function. However, the study raised questions regarding its limited sampling (mostly male veterans) as well as the number of potential study participants who declined randomization into a treatment group. They also used a non-validated Knee Specific Pain score. Also, patients with substantial malalignment (varus or valgus deformity) and those with advanced disease, who might have a poorer response to surgical intervention were included in the trial.\n\nSaeed et al. 2015 compared HA injections versus arthroscopic debridement in patients with OA in an RCT where only the pain component of the knee society score was utilized. In the short-term follow-up of 6 months, arthroscopy failed to show better pain outcome than injections.\n\nMost of the studies excluded patients with meniscal tear, loose body, or other mechanical derangement, with concomitant diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee.

The group considered a comprehensive initial assessment to be a prerequisite for the individualised management strategy described in recommendation 2. The recommendation on the initial assessment included the following elements: the person’s physical status, activities of daily living, participation, mood and health education needs, health beliefs and motivation to self-manage. In the absence of evidence from studies on the effectiveness of various forms of assessment, the group based the recommended content of the initial assessment on the main areas of disease consequences, including potentially inter acting personal and environmental factors described in the literature. Evaluation of cardiovascular disease, people’s expectations and self-efficacy were also discussed as important aspects in a biopsychosocial approach.

With that in mind, only a small number of modern studies have formally investigated use of a cane for knee osteoarthritis. Our literature review found one high-quality study (Jones 2012) showing support for use regarding moderate pain relief and another study (Van Ginckel 2019) of moderate quality showing no major improvement in pain.\n\nJones 2012 performed a comprehensive study of use of a cane for knee osteoarthritis. Their primary outcome was pain, but they also looked at function, general health, consumption of NSAIDs, and energy expenditure. 64 patients were selected out of a total of 323 patients nominated from a rheumatology clinic. The majority of possible patients (168 out of 323) refused to participate in the study. 32 patients were randomized to use of a cane for 60 days (EG, experimental group). The cane was cut to appropriate height, and they received instructions on its use. The 32 control patients (CG) were instructed to maintain a normal lifestyle and not to use auxiliary gait devices. At 30 and 60 days, the EG patients had less pain compared to controls. The greatest improvement was in the VAS (10 cm scale): EG averaging 3.84 cm and CG 5.95 cm at 60 days. The Lequesne scale (0-24) difference was only 2.53 (CG 15.09 and EG 12.56 at 60 days). At 60 days, the study group consumed fewer NSAIDs than control.\n\nVan Ginckel 2019 evaluated use of a cane in patients with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis and bone marrow lesions (BML) on MRI. The primary intent of their study was to identify an effect on the size of BML by using a cane. Out of 1989 potential patients (contacted by phone or online) 231 were considered eligible for radiographic screening and of those, only 79 showed arthritic changes on plain films and BML on MRI and chose to continue with the study. 40 patients were assigned to use a cane whenever walking for the next 12 weeks. 39 control patients were instructed to maintain their usual lifestyle without any gait aids. Only one patient in the control group was lost to follow up. After 3 months, there was no significant improvement in BML size. Secondary information was obtained relative to clinical characteristics. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regards to knee pain (WOMAC scale) or quality of life (AQoL 6-D scale) although there was improvement in global knee pain in the group using the cane.","RecommendationStatus":"Recommend","StrengthofRecommendation":"Strong\/moderate","CertaintyofEvidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline specific question":"Is Chondroitin recommended for Pharmacologic Treatment of osteoarthritis.","Short_answer":"Chondroitin is Not Recommend for hand osteoarthritis PharmacologicTreatment.

According to 2013 European League Against Rheumatism(EULAR) recommendations for the non-pharmacological core management of hip and knee osteoarthritis\n All people with knee\/hip OA should receive an comprehensive management plan (a package of care) that includes the core non-pharmacological approaches, specifically: a information and education regarding OA\nb addressing maintenance and pacing of activity\nc addressing a regular individualised exercise regimen\nd addressing weight loss if overweight or obese\ne* reduction of adverse mechanical factors (eg, appropriate footwear)\nf* consideration of walking aids and assistive technology\nThis recommendation deals with the provision of an integrated package of care rather than single treatments alone or in succession. The group recommended five core interventions to be considered comprehensively in every patient with hip or knee OA. The recommendation specifically implies that a person with hip or knee OA should receive education about her\/his\ncondition (3a), and be managed accordingly (3b–e). With the exception of walking aids and assistive technology and dealing with adverse mechanical factors, the literature sup ports the delivery of combined interventions including information and education, exercise and\/or weight reduction. In people with hip and\/or knee OA the combination of patient education or self-management intervention plus exercise was found to have a significant effect on pain, but a less marked effect on function. In people with hip OA the effect of such combinations was mainly seen on function (0–100 point scale) at 3 and 6 months after intervention (mean\ndifference, 95% CI −7.5, −13.9 to −1.0; and −8.4, −15.1 to −1.7).

This evidence suggested\nthat non-response to analgesics may be associated with a need for joint replacement.\nLonger duration of symptoms did not appear to be associated with the need for joint\nreplacement, which may show that the symptom duration is less relevant than non-\nresponse to treatments. Evidence for the Oxford Hip and Knee scores and the Knee injury\nand Osteoarthritis Outcome score (KOOS) and Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome\nScore (HOOS) summary score showed that these numerical scales alone were unlikely to determine whether someone should have surgery, so they were not recommended for use.\nThe committee agreed that the decision to refer someone for joint replacement should be\nbased on clinical assessment after trying all appropriate treatments for that person. These\nshould have been tried for a sufficient length of time to ensure they are not effective at\nreducing symptoms before referral happens. Given the absence of evidence, the\ncommittee made a recommendation for research on indicators for joint replacement in\npeople with osteoarthritis.\nEvidence on weight loss before surgery showed that, after hip or knee replacement, there\nwas no difference in outcomes for people in different body mass index (BMI) categories.\nPeople who were overweight or obese based on BMI did not have an increased mortality\nrate after surgery and had improved health-related quality of life and patient-reported\noutcome measures. For people who were underweight based on BMI, evidence showed an\nincreased mortality rate. However, the committee considered that this may be due to\ncomorbidities and that the effect may be exaggerated by the smaller number of\nunderweight participants in studies. Some studies combined the healthy weight group with\nthe underweight group, which made interpreting the evidence more difficult. The\ncommittee acknowledged that BMI can give a false impression of the risks and that other\nfactors need to be considered, such as comorbidities. The committee concluded that BMI,\nand other measurements of whether someone is overweight or obese, should not be a\nbarrier to joint replacement.\nSimilarly, the committee agreed that everyone should be treated equally, and people\nshould not be excluded from referral for joint replacement based on their age, sex or\ngender, if they smoke or any comorbidities. They agreed that there are few\ncontraindications to surgery and the surgeon would be best placed to assess and discuss\nsuitability of joint replacement on a case-by-case basis.

According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty).\nTen high-quality studies were reviewed that compared a supervised exercise program to a non-exercise control (e.g., no treatment, heat only, education, usual primary care). (Christensen 2015, Holsgaard-Larsen 2018, Oliveira 2012, Willamson 2007, de Rooij 2017, Imoto 2012, Topp 2002, Hu 2020, Kim 2013, Chen 2014) Seven of these studies found greater improvements in pain, function, or both pain and function over the non-exercise control group (Oliveira 2012, de Rooij 2017, Imoto 2012, Topp 2002, Hu 2020, Kim 2013, Chen 2014).\nOne high-quality study and four moderate-quality studies were reviewed that compared supervised exercise to a non-supervised exercise program (e.g., home program, internet-based program, exercise brochure). (McCarthy 2004, Allen 2018, Yilmaz 2019, Tunay 2010, Bennell 2014). Patients from both groups received benefit from the interventions but there were mixed results as to whether supervised exercise was superior to the non-supervised exercise programs. It appears that both supervised or non-supervised exercise programs can result in improved pain and function in people with knee osteoarthritis.\nFour high-quality studies and one moderate-quality study were reviewed that compared aquatic exercise to either usual primary care, education, or self-management. (Kuptniratsaikul 2019, Rewald 2020, Waller 2017, Munukka 2020, Dias 2017.) Three high-quality studies reported greater improvements in pain, function, or global ratings of improvement for the aquatic groups over the control groups. (Kuptniratsaikul 2019, Rewald 2020, Dias 2017) One high-quality study reported increased leisure time activity for the aquatic group compared to the control. (Waller 2017) One moderate-quality study compared aquatic exercise to land-based exercise. (Silva 2008) There was no difference in WOMAC pain and function scores reported between groups for this study, but the aquatic exercise group had less pain with walking compared to the land-based group. Although there may be some benefit from aquatic exercise, inconsistent results do not allow us to recommend aquatic exercise over land-based exercise at this time.\nSeveral studies examined clinical outcomes for different modes of exercise in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Ebnezar 2012 reported some improvement in anxiety measures when comparing yoga to non-yoga exercise. (Ebnezar 2012) Other studies compared weightbearing to non-weightbearing exercise (Bennell 2020, Jan 2009), high versus low resistance training (Jan 2008), isokinetic, isometric, and isotonic exercise (Huang 2005), and leg versus hip exercise (Lun 2015) and did not find substantial differences in the mode of exercise. It appears that exercise is beneficial, but the mode of exercise may not matter as much as engaging in any exercise program.\n\nExercise is Recommend for Hip osteoarthritis ExerciseTreatment.

According to 2013 European League Against Rheumatism(EULAR) recommendations for the non-pharmacological core management of hip and knee osteoarthritis.\nThe mode of delivery of exercise education (eg, individual 1 : 1 sessions, group classes, etc) and use of pools or other facilities should be selected according both to the preference of the person with hip or knee OA and local availability. Important principles of all exercise include:\na† ‘small amounts often’ (pacing, as with other activities)\nb† linking exercise regimens to other daily activities (eg, just before morning shower or meals) so they become part of\nlifestyle rather than additional events\nc* starting with levels of exercise that are within the individual’s capability, but building up the ‘dose’ sensibly over several months\nThere is convincing evidence for the overall effectiveness of exercise on pain (ES, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.30 to 0.50) and function (ES, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.25 to 0.49) in people with knee OA,87 and to a lesser extent in people with hip OA (ES, 95% CI, pain 0.38, 0.08 to 0.68). Few studies have directly compared different exercise ‘dosage’ (frequency, intensity and duration) and progression approaches in people with OA.87 89 90 One RCT reported reduced pain from attending a progressive functional strengthening pro gramme compared with a non-progressive programme in people with knee OA,90 but two trials could not show any differences from attending various intensity levels of aerobic or resistance-exercise programmes.89 91 Hence, the optimal exercise ‘dosage’ and rate of progression remain uncertain. In patients with knee OA different delivery modes (individual, group-based or home programmes) have all been shown to effectively reduce pain (individual, ES, 95% CI 0.55, 0.29 to 0.81; group-based, ES, 95% CI 0.37, 0.24 to 0.51; and, home, ES, 95% CI 0.28, 0.16 to 0.39) and improve function (individual, ES, 95% CI 0.52, 0.19 to 0.86; group-based, ES, 95% CI 0.35, 0.19 to 0.50; and, home, ES, 95% CI 0.28, 0.17 to 0.38) compared with education, telephone calls, waiting list, relaxation, ultrasound, hot-packs or no treatment. In patients with hip and\/or knee OA, water-based exercise was found to significantly reduce pain (ES, 95% CI 0.19, 0.04 to 0.35) and improve function (ES, 95% CI 0.26, 0.11 to 0.42) compared with education, telephone calls or no intervention. Home-based exercise was found to be as effective as water based exercise in one small RCT in people with hip OA. Water-based exercise can include swimming and\/or different types of exercise programmes. Since the different modes of delivery are equally effective, the person’s preference, findings of the initial assessment and local availability should determine the choice of mode of delivery in clinical practice. The literature suggests that pacing of activity and\/or integrating physical activity into daily living as part of a comprehensive exercise regimen is more effective in people with hip or knee OA or with knee pain than usual care or written information, but not compared with standardised exercise or a pharmacy review. This recommendation suggests the need for an increase in the intensity and\/or duration of exercise over time. This is based on the literature, where most strength training exercise programmes evaluated in people with knee OA included dynamic exercises with progression over time. Moreover, in one study comparing progressive and non progressive approaches in people with knee OA, the former was found to reduce pain more effectively. General recommendations for dosage and progression of exercise in older people and people with chronic disease are aerobic moderate-intensity training for at least 30 min\/day or up to 60 min for greater benefit, and progressive strength training involving the major muscle groups at least 2 days\/week at a level of moderate to vigorous intensity (60–80% of one repetition maximum) for 8–12 repetitions.96 97 These recommendations emphasise that in people with chronic disease who do not reach the recommended level, they should be as physically active as their abilities and condition allow.","RecommendationStatus":"Recommend","StrengthofRecommendation":"Not specified","CertaintyofEvidence":"Ia"},{"Guideline specific question":"Is Exercise tailored to patient's need recommended for Exercise Treatment of  osteoarthritis.","Short_answer":"Exercise tailored to patient's need is Recommended for  osteoarthritis ExerciseTreatment.

According to 2022 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for osteoarthritis in over 16s: diagnosis and management.\nOsteoarthrits is diagnosed clinically and usually does not need imaging to confirm the diagnosis and management should be guided by symptoms and physical function and the core treatments for the condition are therapeutic exercise and weight management (if appropriate), along with information and support. \nEvidence showed that generally people with osteoarthritis wanted more information about their condition. This included information about the causes, what their diagnosis means for the future and where to find more information on self-management. The committee based their recommendations on the evidence and their experience. They agreed that it is important to tell people that diagnosis is made clinically without imaging, that imaging rarely provides any extra information helpful for diagnosing or planning non-surgical treatment for osteoarthritis, and that it would only be used if there were suspicion of an alternative diagnosis or other complications. This would help reassure and dispel any belief that X-rays or other forms of imaging are needed to diagnose osteoarthritis. \nThe committee noted the importance of information that offers hope for the future and supports self-management strategies (for example, information that emphasises symptom-reducing behaviours, like therapeutic exercise). They agreed that explaining the core treatments for osteoarthritis would help people understand that pharmacological treatments are not a long-term solution. They also agreed that information about recognising flares and how to manage changes in pain would help the person better understand how their condition may vary over time and what they can do about it. The committee noted more evidence was needed on information about managing flares and information for different populations of people with osteoarthritis, and so made recommendations for research on what information people with osteoarthritis need. \nThe committee agreed that each person's experience of osteoarthritis differs and therefore tailoring the information to their needs, as described in NICE's guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services, is important. They also agreed that osteoarthritis is more common in older people who are likely to have other conditions.

The strength of recommendation is Limited. The certainty of evidence is Not specified. According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty).\n\nHigh tibial osteotomy may be considered to improve pain and function in properly indicated patients with unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis.\n\nHigh tibial osteotomy (HTO) has been used for pain relief of medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Realigning the varus knee provides mechanical decompression of the medial compartment. An osteotomy line is created in the proximal tibial, and either a wedge defect is created by opening the medial cortex and held open with a wedge or plate and screw hardware, or a lateral wedge is removed and secured commonly with staples or wires. In the Nerhus 2017 study, patients continued to show improvement 6 and 12 months post-operatively. Historical studies have reported pain reduction with survival rates approximately 70% at 10 years (“survival” usually interpreted with endpoint conversion to replacement) (van Outeren cites Brouwer 2014 and Niinimaki 2012).\n\nMany studies available for review by the workgroup compared various techniques of osteotomy in randomized studies. Ogawa 2019 found osteotomy distal to the tibial tubercle to be superior to proximal osteotomy for an opening wedge procedure with regard to patellofemoral pain. Arthroscopic evaluation of the knee joint at the time of osteotomy and second look at the time of hardware removal showed less patellar and trochlear degeneration with the distal osteotomy group.\n\nNerhus 2017 saw no significant functional difference between surgical patients randomized to either opening or closing wedge, with all showing improvement.\n\nDuivenvoorden 2014 reported improved HSS scores from 71 to 81 at 6 years post-op. VAS scores improved from 6.1 baseline to a statistically significant difference at follow up of 4.0 in the opening wedge patients and 3.2 with the closing wedge (albeit no statistical difference between the groups). It should be noted that patients lost to follow up started with a VAS score of 6.6, thus tempering the analysis of late results.\n\nBrouwer 2006 performed a prospective randomized trial comparing closing wedge and opening wedge techniques. Closing wedge was secured with two surgical staples and opening wedge with a Puddu plate. After one year, VAS score had improved from 6.1 to 3.6.\n\nVan Outeren 2017 is perhaps the closest attempt to a large randomized control trial between surgery and non-operative management. However, this is still not a highest quality randomized control trial. The researchers gathered two different groups of patients at two different hospitals. The first group underwent randomization to valgus bracing versus usual care. The second group was randomized to HTO with either an opening wedge or closing wedge osteotomy. The groups were matched for baseline characteristics. They found HTO more effective in pain reduction compared to non-operative methods. VAS changed from baseline 6.2 in the surgery group to 3.8 post-op. The control group improved from 6.4 to 5.0. Function was improved only in comparison of surgical patients to usual care treatment.\n\nThe Wu 2017 study evaluated people with bilateral OA with pain around the medial part of the knee. The more degenerative knee got proximal tibial osteotomy, and the other knee got usual non-operative care. The study authors included a table of individual patient data, which allowed a model that controlled for differences in baseline knee society function scores between the knees to be run. With this model, the odds ratio of achieving satisfactory knee society function scores (defined as score >= 80) with osteotomy vs. non-operative treatment was 7.51 (CI 1.094, 51.6).\n\nThe Tibial Osteotomy recommendation has been downgraded one level because of inconsistent evidence.","RecommendationStatus":"may be used","StrengthofRecommendation":"Limited","CertaintyofEvidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline specific question":"Is Hydroxychloroquine recommended for Pharmacologic\nTreatment of osteoarthritis.","Short_answer":"Hydroxychloroquine is Not Recommend for hand osteoarthritis PharmacologicTreatment, knee osteoarthritis PharmacologicTreatment or  hip osteoarthritis PharmacologicTreatment.

Individualised treatment does not imply that every treatment should be individually provided, it means rather that treatment is personalised, or tailored. RCTs on individualised on pharmacological management are scant. The available studies showed reduced pain (mean difference, 95% CI (0–20 pointscale): −1.19, −2.1 to −0.3 and −1.10, −1.84 to −0.19; and (0–100 scale): −17.0, −23.6 to −10.4) and improved physical function (mean difference, 95% CI (0–68 point scale): 3.65, 1.0 to 6.3 and 3.33, 0.78 to 5.88) compared with usual care,24–26 but not compared with group-based rehabilitation or information on healthy lifestyle.

Moreover, individualised treatment being the standard of care in OA and chronic disease in general was considered to imply informed, shared decision-making, taking into account the person’s wishes and preferences. The group noted that with the conduct of an RCT to study the impact of individualisation, the patient’s view cannot be wholly taken into account and that some element of individualisation will always be incorporated in any treatment.

The strength of recommendation is Strong. The certainty of evidence is Not specified. According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty).\nAlthough lateral heel wedges had historical support for their use in knee arthritis, contemporary studies have not shown a reliable improvement in pain relief, and no contemporary studies have shown sufficient functional improvement for patients suffering from knee arthritis to recommend using lateral wedge insoles. Lateral heel wedges can be prepared as an insert for the heel alone, or included in the heel of an independent arch support (i.e. lateral heel wedge arch support of LWAS) or built into the shoe itself (as was used by Hinman et al 2016). In the arthritic knee, medial compartment compression forces are commonly increased, especially in the knee with varus tibiofemoral alignment. The knee adduction moment can be calculated by gait analysis. The lateral wedge is thought to change the knee adduction moment thus relieving medial compartment pressure, hence relieving arthritic pain.\nOur literature review screening culled several papers for analysis. Baker and Goggins 2007 was a high-quality study finding no important differences between insole and wedged insole. 90 patients were randomized to one treatment for 6 weeks followed by a 4-week washout period and then the opposite treatment. There were no major differences in pain during either phase of the study. More musculoskeletal symptoms and more blisters occurred with neutral insoles. No patient falls were attributed to the treatment alternatives.\nFelson and Parke 2019 prescreened patients to eliminate those with patellofemoral OA and biomechanical non-responders. Lateral wedge insoles reduced knee pain, but the effect of treatment was small and was considered likely of clinical significance in only a minority of patients. 21 of 83 of patients did not show sufficient biomechanical correction. Only 28% of patients in the active phase of treatment had minimally important improvement whereas 22% of patients wearing neutral insoles reached the same level of improvement. 2 patients stopped treatment while wearing lateral wedge insoles (calf pain at night and increased knee pain) and 2 stopped while wearing neutral insoles (toe blister and increased knee pain). They also looked at volume of arthritic bone marrow lesions (BML) found by MRI and saw no significant difference in BML change between study and control groups.\nIn Bennell 2011, 89 patients with mild to moderate knee arthritis completed follow up with lateral insoles worn daily for 12 months. 90 patients completed follow up as the control group wearing neutral insoles. Pain relief after 12 months showed no significant difference between the groups.\nIn Hsieh 2016, 90 patients with Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 or higher radiographic changes were randomized to either a rigid insole with lateral wedge arch support (LWAS) or a soft insole with lateral wedge. Dropout rate was 20% with rigid and 15.6% with soft insoles over the 3-month long study. They concluded that patients using the soft insole LWAS had improved pain and function. However, their primary data suggests better walking time and speed going up and down stairs with rigid LWAS.\nFurthermore, pain was improved with soft LWAS only at the 3-month mark. Authors suggested longer-term follow-up for soft insoles.\nHinman 2016 evaluated an unloading shoe with stiff lateral midsole and 5-degree lateral wedge insole in comparison to a standard walking shoe. 164 patients were enrolled with 96% retention during the 6 months study. 83 patients received the unloading shoes and the control shoes. 14 of 83 stopped wearing the unloading shoes for various reasons and 8 of 81 stopped wearing the control shoes. 160 completed primary outcome measures at 6 months. There was no significant difference between groups with regard to pain or function, although both groups did show improvement.\n20% of participants with the study shoes reported ankle and foot pain whereas 9% of control shoe participants did so. There was no difference in the reason to discontinue treatment (unloading shoe 4% versus 2% control). Other reported adverse events were back pain, hip pain, knee pain, knee stiffness\/swelling, and shin\/calf pain. 2 of 83 experimental group patients reported an increase in knee pain with the unloading shoe and 2 of 81 control patients reported that the conventional shoe did not relieve knee pain.\nToda 2004 followed 84 knee female arthritis patients were followed for one month wearing either a hard rubber insole or urethane insole secured to the foot with a subtalar strap used for ankle sprains. 12 mm lateral wedge was manufactured for both. 17 of the 42 rubber insole patients had complications (foot pain in 8; popliteal pain in 6; low back pain in 3) versus 8 of the 42 using urethane insoles (popliteal pain in 4; foot pain in 3; low back pain in 1). All patients improved by the Lequesne Index with the urethane group achieving statistically significant improvement.\nNiazi 2014 was a comparison of off-loading knee brace versus lateral wedge insole. 120 patients with both radiographic medial compartment arthritis and gene varum were randomized to either knee brace or lateral wedge insole. Pain improvement with the knee brace group was statistically significant compared to the lateral wedge insole, but clinically minor (VAS 3.97 in the study group compared to 4.53 in controls).\nIn Hatef 2013, 118 of 150 patients completed the 2-month long study (101 women and 17 men). Half were given LWAS, and the control group wore neutral insoles. Patient compliance was much worse in the LWAS group. They noted statistically significant decline in knee pain and EKFS in women in the LWAS, but not men. Overall, there was improvement in the LWAS group. There was a much higher non-compliance rate in the LWAS than with the neutral insoles with 29 of 57 patients stopping use of the insoles by weeks 5 to 6 of an 8-week study.\nWe identified one potential study within our literature which addressed the question of special shoe versus a conventional shoe. Nigg 2006 evaluated a training shoe which purports to convert a flat hard surface into “natural uneven ground”, thus prompting increased muscle activity in the lower extremity. The control shoe was a standard walking shoe. 58 patients were enrolled in the study group and 67 in the control group. Both groups had one patient drop out (cumbersome shoes in the study group and increased knee pain with the control shoe). Pain with walking was improved at 12 weeks in both groups, without between groups difference. The study shoe showed increased pain relief at 3, 6, and 12 weeks. The control shoe showed increased pain relief at 3 and 12 weeks. They also reported improved balance from baseline in the study shoe at 12 weeks, which was not statistically significant.","RecommendationStatus":"Not Recommend","StrengthofRecommendation":"Conditional\/Strong","CertaintyofEvidence":"Ia\/Very low\/Not specified"},{"Guideline specific question":"Is Medial wedged insoles recommended for Physical Treatment of osteoarthritis.","Short_answer":"Medial wedged insoles is Not Recommend for Hip osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment or Knee osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment.

According to 2013 European League Against Rheumatism(EULAR) recommendations for the non-pharmacological core management of hip and knee osteoarthritis.\nWhen lifestyle changes are recommended, people with hip or knee OA should receive an individually tailored programme, including long-term and short-term goals, intervention or action plans, and regular evaluation and follow-up with possibilities for adjustment of the programme\n It is known that behavioural changes are difficult to achieve\nand maintain, and the effect of advice and counselling by healthcare providers is disappointing.56 The literature search for this recommendation was limited to lifestyle changes considered most relevant for hip and knee OA—that is, exercise and weight loss. The common feature in the trials supporting this recommendation was to teach and encourage behavioural change strategies through goal setting of physical activity and weight changes, action plans to maintain changes and regular follow-up over at least 1 year to re-evaluate and discuss goals and action plans. Reports examining the effectiveness of specific elements to be included in interventions aiming to change behaviour are scarce. The literature suggests that the following factors improve adherence to exercise or physical activity: individual exercise, graded activity, individualisation according to the person’s exercise goals, feedback on progress made towards the goals, iterative problem solving with emphasis on skills that will improve adherence, reinforcements of maintaining exercise such as additional motivational programmes, exercise plans and log books, written information and audiotape or videotape, and booster sessions. In addition, some studies found an effect on pain or function59 from lifestyle interventions that integrate such elements. A systematic review including a mixed population of people with OA and\/or rheumatoid arthritis found effect sizes of 0.21 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.34) for pain and 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.88) for increased physical activity from lifestyle interventions aiming at increasing physical activity.64 Over 40% of the included lifestyle interventions prompted problem solving, self-monitoring, goal setting and\nregular feedback. For people with knee OA or knee pain, improvements were seen in pain, function and weight loss from diet interventions that included individual weight-loss goals, problem solving on how to reach these goals and follow-up visits to re-evaluate and discuss goals in combination with exercise. In obese patients, weight-loss programmes with explicit weight-loss goals showed a higher mean change in weight than pro grammes without explicit goals. This indicates that the elements in recommendation 4 are important for the change and long-term maintenance of behaviour. The group discussed the importance of regular follow-up that includes feedback on the progress towards explicit goals and extends over a long time to achieve long-term effects of a healthy lifestyle.","RecommendationStatus":"Recommend","StrengthofRecommendation":"Not specified","CertaintyofEvidence":"Ib"},{"Guideline specific question":"Is local cold application (eg ice packs) recommended for Physical\nTreatment of osteoarthritis.","Short_answer":"Local cold application (eg ice packs) is Not Recommend for Knee osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment or Hip osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment.

The committee acknowledged the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) safety warnings on NSAIDs for cardiovascular safety, renal safety and gastrointestinal risk. They agreed that NSAIDs, as well as other pharmacological treatments for osteoarthritis, should be used for as short a time as possible and that the potential harms for gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, liver and kidney adverse events should be carefully considered when prescribing. Evidence showed that adding gastroprotection can reduce gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation. However, this was associated with an increase in cardiovascular adverse events compared with oral NSAIDs alone. The committee agreed that this may be unrelated to the addition of gastroprotection and that randomised controlled trial evidence alone may not be the best source for safety evidence, because the population size and length of follow-up are usually limited. Therefore, they also used their clinical experience and guidance from other organisations, including the MHRA. Based on this, the committee agreed that use of gastroprotection should be offered with NSAIDs.\n\nOral NSAIDs is Recommend for Knee osteoarthritis PharmacologicTreatment and Hip osteoarthritis PharmacologicTreatment. The strength of recommendation is Conditional. The certainty of evidence is Moderate. According to 2018 Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Guideline for the management of knee and hip osteoarthritis.\nIt might be reasonable to trial oral NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for a short period, then discontinue use if not effective. Clinicians also need to inform individuals about, monitor and capture adverse events, especially gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular, which may be associated with use of NSAIDs.\nNSAIDs are anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents commonly used for OA. NSAIDs are effective anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs by virtue of their ability to inhibit biosynthesis of PGs at the level of the COX. It is thought that inhibiting COX-2 leads to the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects, and those NSAIDs also inhibiting COX-1 may cause gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers in large doses\nThe potential harms of NSAIDs are well recognised, and include gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular adverse effects. Older persons, who are at higher risk for OA, may also be at higher risk of adverse effects from NSAIDs, so this class of medication should be used with caution. Formal estimation of cardiovascular risk may be worthwhile using a validated tool (eg www.cvdcheck.org.au). In individuals at low absolute risk of harms, a judicious trial of NSAIDs may be considered, aiming for the lowest effective dose. Co-prescription of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) or the use of a COX-2 inhibitor should be considered in people at risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects. The balance of benefits and risks may vary between NSAIDs and between individuals; however, no particular drug is likely to be superior to others, nor is any NSAID free from the potential for harm.\n\n\n\noral NSAIDs is Recommend for knee osteoarthritis PharmacologicalTreatment.

Although meta-analysis of non-selective oral NSAIDs compared to controls demonstrated a meaningful reduction in pain, the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively high degree of heterogeneity. The meta-analysis of non-selective oral NSAIDs compared to controls demonstrated a meaningful improvement in function with an acceptable degree of heterogeneity. In terms of selective COX-2 oral NSAIDs, the meta-analysis of celecoxib, the only available selective COX-2 oral NSAID on the United States market, demonstrated a meaningful reduction in pain and improved function with an acceptable degree of heterogeneity. The comparison of non-selective and selective COX-2 oral NSAIDs shows no significant difference in the effectiveness between the types of oral NSAIDs . Although NSAIDs effectively reduce pain and improve function in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, providers should consider patient comorbidities, the type of NSAID administered, dose, and duration of administration. In fact, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a black-box warning for NSAIDs citing an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events and serious gastrointestinal events. Therefore, we recommend the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible for the patient. Although selective COX-2 oral NSAIDs were developed to reduce gastrointestinal adverse events compared to non-selective oral NSAIDs, meta-analysis did not reveal a significant reduction in gastrointestinal adverse events.","RecommendationStatus":"Recommend","StrengthofRecommendation":"Conditional\/Not specified","CertaintyofEvidence":"Not specified\/Moderate\/Not specified"},{"Guideline specific question":"Is Oral opioids recommended for Pharmacologic Treatment of osteoarthritis.","Short_answer":"Oral opioids is Not Recommend for Knee osteoarthritis PharmacologicTreatment or Hip osteoarthritis PharmacologicTreatment.

According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty).\n\nSix high-quality studies (Saffari 2018, Somers 2012, Cagnin 2019, Gilbert 2018, Baker 2019, Berman 2004) thirteen moderate quality study (Brosseau 2012, Allen 2010, O’Brien 2018, Allen 2010, Bennell 2017, Marra 2012, Rezende 2017, Sandeghi 2019, Rodriguez da Silva 2017, Rini 2015, Moseng 2020, Chen 2020, Ravaud 2009) and two limited quality studies compared patient education and control. These studies reported more significant improvements in pain compared to the control groups.\n\nPatient education programs in studies overlap with self-management programs. Patient education programs vary from patient handout, 2+ hour DVD, one-day education to multiple sessions over a month (Saffari 2018, Cagnin 2019, Brosseau 2012, O’Brien 2018, Rezende 2017, Rodriguez da Silva 2017, Rini 2015). Many studies are challenging to evaluate the effects of education because they involve exercise classes and other proven interventions (Marra 2012, Ravaud 2009). Self-management programs train people in several elements of self-management for osteoarthritis (1148), including medication compliance, pain management, and pain coping strategies, joint protection strategies (1149) during physical activity, exercise advice, problem-solving approaches, and stress management techniques. Patient education programs may not be as labor-intensive, and further work is needed to identify the amount of education needed to improve patient-related outcome measures, like pain.\n\nPrograms that focused on education are two high quality (Saffari 2018, Cagnin 2019) and four moderate quality (Brosseau 2012, O’Brien 2018, Rodriguez da Silva 2017, Rini 2015). Saffari used seven (7) group sessions over one month and provided a CD-ROM and booklet describing preventive lifestyle procedures and the importance of treatment adherence (Saffari 2018). They found improvement in SF-12 and pain scores. Cagnin used an educational session with a physical therapist who demonstrated how recommended exercises should be performed and how patients can manage their pain. They demonstrated improvement in KOOS pain scores (Cagnin 2019). Brousseau looked at education (educational pamphlet) vs. walking and education vs. walking and behavioral intervention (Brouseau 2012). There was a non-clinically significant improvement in pain in the education-only group at 12 months compared to walking and behavioral intervention. O’Brien used weight loss education, where trained telephone interviewers provided brief advice and education about the benefits of weight loss and physical activity for knee osteoarthritis immediately after randomization [O’Brien 2018]. The intervention group provided an evidence-based public health non-disease-specific telephone-based coaching service funded by the local Australian state government to support adults in making sustained lifestyle improvements, including diet, physical activity, and achieving a healthy weight and, where appropriate, access smoking cessation services. They did not find an added benefit from the coaching service over the brief telephone education in pain nor WOMAC scores. Rini compared an internet-based app (PainCoach) [http:\/\/tri.ad\/projects-2\/] to usual care and found a non-clinically significant reduction in VAS pain scores (Rini 2015). Rodriguez da Silva used a single day (Saturday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.), which included seven lectures of 30 min by each professional team, and 60-min workshops by the physical education, physical therapy, and occupational therapy professionals, approaching the importance of their area in knee OA treatment\/management. The study did not report pain scores but did note an increase in mobility with improvements in the get-up and go test. The two high-quality and four moderate-quality studies showed improved pain scores from the education given during educational sessions. Most studies (15 of the 21) incorporate education with other interventions; therefore, it is impossible to isolate the effects of education in these other 15 studies.\n\nOne high quality (Gilbert 2018) and three moderate quality (Rezende 2017, Chen 202, Ravaud 2009) used the transtheoretical model (TTM) and motivational interviewing to improve osteoarthritis treatment adherence. These studies showed improvement in WOMAC pain scores.

The strength of recommendation is Limited. The certainty of evidence is Not specified. According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty).\nThere were two high (Rayegani; 2014, Gormeli; 2017) and one moderate (Akan; 2018) study with 30 people per group comparing PRP vs. control. There were mixed results in the studies for pain and function. A meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity. Two studies (Akan; 2018, Gormeli; 2017) looked at PRP in severe OA with mixed results. Two studies (Rayegani; 2014, Gormeli; 2017) looked at change in all stages of OA at a six-month timeframe. The studies had mixed results. One study (Gormeli; 2017) looked at Kellgren-Lawrence 1-3 stage OA with improvement in IKDC and EQ-VAS. Therefore, due to the heterogeneity of results and the difference in early and late stage OA results, we downgraded the recommendation to Limited from Strong. We feel these recommendations may change with future research on the use of PRP in different levels of severity of OA.\nThe number of PRP injections had mixed results with the studies with three PRP injections (Akan; 2018, Gormeli; 2017) having positive results outcomes for pain and function. Studies with one and two PRP injections had mixed results, with the positive being less likely clinically significant changes in pain and function. Further research should be done to determine the number of PRP injections for treatment of KOA. Currently, three IA-PRP injections appear to have more favorable results.\nAdverse events from PRP injections have been investigated in one high-quality study (Huang; 2018) reported adverse events for PRP vs. control. They reported hypertension and proteinuria were treatment-related side-effects. These met Common Toxicity Criteria grade ≥3. This raises questions on the safety of PRP, which needs further evaluation. Therefore, the strength of recommendation was downgraded to Limited.\nWhen evaluating the effectiveness of PRP vs HA, there were eight high-quality studies (Sanchez; 2012, Vaquerizo; 2013, Filardo; 2015, Gormeli; 2017, Cole; 2017, Buendia-Lopez; 2018, Di Martino; 2019, Yaradilmis; 2020) and six (6) medium-quality studies (Spakova; 2012, Raeissadat; 2015, Lana; 2016, Duymus; 2017, Raeissadat; 2017, Ahmad; 2018) and one low-quality study (Sanchez; 2008) that investigated IA-PRP vs. IA-HA. Four studies were included in a meta-analysis of Total WOMAC results at the 9- OR 12-months mark. This analysis showed a clinically significant difference for IA-PRP over IA-HA. The results between IA-PRP vs IA-HA diverged after 6 months. Most studies showed similar results between IA-PRP and IA-HA at six months, except one (Yaradilimis 2020) where the LR-PRP total WOMAC was better at all time points than the IA HA. Both the patients in the IA HA and IA PRP improved in total WOMAC at six months. Patients in the IA-PRP-arms maintained improvement after 6 months at the 9- OR 12-months mark for total WOMAC vs. IA-HA which started to have a worsening score. The standard is to inject IA-HA every six months in patients with painful KOA. The preparation of the PRP (LR-PRP vs LP-PRP) was noted to be different with the LR-PRP had higher MID values than LP-PRP vs. IA-HA. The research highlights the prolonged effect of IA-PRP over IA-HA, though both appear to be equivalent at 6 months.\nPatient-related outcome measures (OARSI-OMERACT responders, percentage of subjects meeting a percentage reduction in VAS Pain OR WOMAC Pain scores) (Sanchez; 2008, Sanchez; 2012, Vaquerizo; 2013, Buendia-Lopez; 2018) more often favored IA-PRP at both the six-month and 12-month time frame. Further research is needed using standardized PROMs to investigate the effectiveness of IA-PRP to determine if more patients will benefit from IA-PRP at six months over IA-HA.\nAdverse events were higher in the PRP group than IA HA, both local soreness and injection pain (two studies (Spakova; 2012, Yaradilmis; 2020)) and one study (Huang; 2018) reported systemic events (proteinuria and hypertension). One study (Vaquerizo; 2013) did not find a difference in comparing any adverse event, and one study (Raeissadat; 2017) did not see a difference for minor injection-site adverse events. Therefore, there appears to be more studies finding IA-PRP to have more adverse events vs. IA-HA, more research is needed to determine if the adverse events outweigh the benefit of IA-PRP over IA-HA at 9 and 12 months. This is another reason for the downgrade in evidence from Strong to Limited.\nComparisons between IA-PRP and IA-CS, there were three high (Joshi Juber; 2017, Khan; 2018, Nabi; 2018) and one moderate quality study (Huang; 2019). One study (Joshi Juber; 2017) was KL IV end-stage OA and did not find a difference. One study (Khan; 2018) was repeat injections every other month (0, 2, 4 months) with follow up at six months in KL II OAK with no difference. One study (Nabi; 2018) used patients with KL II-III given three injections one month apart showed improvement at three months (one month after the last injection) and six months (4 months after the final injection). One study (Huang; 2019) did three PRP injections every three weeks on KL I-II OAK showed improvement in pain and function at six months (4 months after last injection) and 12 months (10 months after last injection). Therefore, the IA-PRP given in three injections evaluated at 4 months post last injection is more likely to show benefit in KL II and III stages of KOA. More research is needed to evaluate long-term benefits of IA-PRP vs IA-CS over a two- or five-year period to determine if IA-PRP is cartilage sparing vs IA-CS concern for possible cartilage damage over time.\nPRP is defined in LR-PRP and LP-PRP. There may be a difference in the effectiveness in knee osteoarthritis between these two preparations. Currently, there is limited data from one direct comparison (Yaradilimis; 2020) and our meta-analysis (Figure 45) of IA-PRP and IA-HA that would demonstrate that intra-articular LR-PRP vs. LP-PRP for KOA is more likely to demonstrate a benefit at 9 and 12 months. The number of studies is limited, therefore determining the better choice between LR-PRP vs. LP-PRP is still inconclusive, but at this time appears to favor LR-PRP.\nThe Platelet-Rich Plasma recommendation has been downgraded two levels because of inconsistent evidence.\n\nPlatelet rich plasma(PRP) is Not Recommend for hip osteoarthritis PharmacologicTreatment.

This included information about the causes, what their diagnosis means for the future and where to find more information on self-management. The committee based their recommendations on the evidence and their experience. They agreed that it is important to tell people that diagnosis is made clinically without imaging, that imaging rarely provides any extra information helpful for diagnosing or planning non-surgical treatment for osteoarthritis, and that it would only be used if there were suspicion of an alternative diagnosis or other complications. This would help reassure and dispel any belief that X-rays or other forms of imaging are needed to diagnose osteoarthritis. \nThe committee noted the importance of information that offers hope for the future and supports self-management strategies (for example, information that emphasises symptom-reducing behaviours, like therapeutic exercise). They agreed that explaining the core treatments for osteoarthritis would help people understand that pharmacological treatments are not a long-term solution. They also agreed that information about recognising flares and how to manage changes in pain would help the person better understand how their condition may vary over time and what they can do about it. The committee noted more evidence was needed on information about managing flares and information for different populations of people with osteoarthritis, and so made recommendations for research on what information people with osteoarthritis need. \nThe committee agreed that each person's experience of osteoarthritis differs and therefore tailoring the information to their needs, as described in NICE's guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services, is important. They also agreed that osteoarthritis is more common in older people who are likely to have other conditions.

Research about strengthening exercises in knee OA shows that both specific quadriceps strengthening exercises or strength training for the lower limb reduce pain effectively (ES, 95% CI 0.29, 0.06 to 0.51 and 0.53, 0.27 to 0.79, respectively) and improve physical function (ES, 95% CI 0.24, 0.06 to 0.42 and 0.58, 0.27 to 0.88, respectively). The literature on strength training in people with knee OA in most cases describes dynamic exercises, whereas research on isometric exercises is sparse.95 Hip strengthening exercises have been poorly evaluated in people with hip OA. However, in people with medial tibiofemoral knee OA, hip strengthening exercises reduced knee pain and improved physical function. Aerobic training (walking) is effective in reducing pain (ES, 95% CI 0.48, 0.13 to 0.43) and improving physical function (ES, 95% CI 0.35, 0.11 to 0.58) in patients with knee OA. The evidence for mixed exercise programmes, including strengthening, aerobic and flexibility components, in patients with knee OA is conflicting. One type of exercise has not been shown to be better than another (strength, aerobic or mixed exercises). The group reached consensus that mixed programmes should be recommended. However, it was noted that with mixed pro grammes the minimal requirements to improve or maintain muscle strength, aerobic capacity and\/or joint range of motion need to be met, as some reports suggest that mixed pro grammes may be less effective than focused programmes. This recommendation states that initial instruction is required, but that in the longer term the person should integrate exercise into daily life. This part of the recommendation is substantiated by studies showing that the number of super vised sessions influences outcome in people with knee OA. Twelve or more directly supervised sessions have been shown to be more effective than a smaller number on pain (ES 0.46, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.60 vs ES 0.28, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.40, p=0.03) and physical function (ES 0.45, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.62 vs ES 0.23, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.37, p=0.02). In addition, it was noted that research evidence is growing for tai chi and yoga. Though not included in the literature review, tai chi has been found to be effective for the reduction of pain in patients with hip or knee OA, with ES ranging from 0.28 to 1.67.","RecommendationStatus":"Recommend","StrengthofRecommendation":"Not specified","CertaintyofEvidence":"Ia"},{"Guideline specific question":"Is Routine hyaluronic acid intra-articular injection recommended for Pharmacological Treatment of osteoarthritis.","Short_answer":"Routine hyaluronic acid intra-articular injection is Not Recommend for knee osteoarthritis PharmacologicalTreatment.

A comparison of patients from these studies and from studies validating the MCIDs were used to judge clinical significance. Results revealed that patients were demographically comparable for WOMAC and VAS pain as well as WOMAC function based on age, baseline pain scores, BMI, weight, and gender. Meta-analysis in meaningfully important difference (MID) units showed that the effect was less than 0.5 MID units, indicating a low likelihood that an appreciable number of patients achieved clinically important benefits after intraarticular HA injection (Guyatt et al.). When we differentiated high- versus low-molecular weight viscosupplementation (three high, two moderate and two low quality studies), our analyses demonstrated no significant differences among different viscosupplementation formulations. Crosslinking features of the viscosupplemtation product was assessed in two high quality studies. In patients with OA, there was no difference between cross-linked and non-cross-linked HA.\n\nSome studies demonstrated a statistical benefit with the use of HA but could not reach the significance for a minimally clinical meaningful difference, leading to the conclusion that viscosupplementation can represent a viable option for some patients that failed other treatments when appropriately indicated. The number needed to treat to see a tangible benefit from HA was 17 patients. Furthermore, this difference was most evident at 6 weeks and 3 months. Most of the studies that exist in the literature evaluate low to moderate arthritic knees (Kellgren Lawrence of I-III) with worse results in patients with severely affected knees (KL IV).\n\nThe 2013 edition of this guideline strongly recommended against the use of viscosupplementation. In contrast to this updated version, the 2021 version found that statistically significant improvements were associated with high-molecular cross-linked hyaluronic acid but when compared to mid-range molecular weight, statistical significance was not maintained. This newer analysis did not demonstrate clinically relevant differences when compared to controls. However, as previous research reported benefits in their use, the group felt that a specific subset of patients might benefit from its use.\n\nThe Hyaluronic Acid recommendation was downgraded one level due to a lack of generalized results.","RecommendationStatus":"Not Recommend","StrengthofRecommendation":"Moderate","CertaintyofEvidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline specific question":"Is Routine imaging in follow up recommended for Imaging Assessment of  osteoarthritis.","Short_answer":"Routine imaging in follow up is Not recommended for  osteoarthritis ImagingAssessment.

Evidence showed that corticosteroid injections had inconsistent benefits on improving quality of life and physical function for people with hip osteoarthritis, and reducing pain for people with knee osteoarthritis. There was no evidence showing long-term benefit beyond 3 months. Given the potential benefits and committee expert opinion, they agreed that intra-articular corticosteroids could be considered for people with osteoarthritis if other treatments have not worked, provided the person was made aware that the injection would only provide short-term relief (2 to 10 weeks).

They typically include several sessions over several weeks. These programs train people in several elements of self-management for osteoarthritis including medication compliance, pain management and pain coping strategies, joint protection strategies during physical activity, exercise advice, problem-solving approaches, and stress management techniques.\nFour high-quality studies (Saffari 2018, Somers 2012, Hurley 2007, Omidi 2018) and one moderate-quality study (Coleman 2012) compared self-management to usual care or no treatment. These studies reported greater improvements in pain, function, or both compared to the control groups. In addition, some of these studies reported greater improvements in quality of life, pain catastrophizing, and self-efficacy in the self-management groups (Saffari 2018, Somers 2012).\nOne high-quality study (Marconcin 2018) and three moderate-quality studies examined the combined use of self-management and exercise to either groups that received self-management or exercise alone (Bennell 2016) or usual care (Yip 2007, Kao 2012). Yip et al. reported greater improvements in pain, time spent in leisure activities, and self-efficacy, compared to usual care.

The educational part included information about the condition, reassurance that serious disease was not present, self-management, exercises, ergonomic care, booklets, optimal level of physical activity and early return to work.
