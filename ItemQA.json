Since initial assessment will always be a part of the management in any person with hip or knee OA, controlled trials evaluating assessment will have difficulties in selecting the most appropriate comparator. One randomised, controlled\ntrial (RCT) comparing a comprehensive assessment and management approach with usual care showed no difference in pain or physical function.13 However, in that study, both approaches included initial assessments, but with different content and were executed by different professionals. The group considered a comprehensive initial assessment to be a prerequisite for the individualised management strategy described in recommendation 2. The recommendation on the initial assessment included the following elements: the person’s physical status, activities of daily living, participation, mood and health education needs, health beliefs and motivation to self-manage. In the absence of evidence from studies on the effectiveness of various forms of assessment, the group based the recommended content of the initial assessment on the main areas of disease consequences, including potentially inter acting personal and environmental factors described in the literature. Evaluation of cardiovascular disease, people’s expectations and self-efficacy were also discussed as important aspects in a biopsychosocial approach. Moreover, the group found that a comprehensive assessment, which is applicable to the initial consultation, should also be repeated during regular follow-up of the person.","Source":"2013 European League Against Rheumatism(EULAR) recommendations for the non-pharmacological core management of hip and knee osteoarthritis","Location":"Knee","Intervention":"Biopsychosocial initial assessments","Type of recommendation":"Recommend","Strength of recommendation":"Not specified","Certainty of evidence":"IIb"},{"Guideline_Specific_Question":"Is Biopsychosocial initial assessments recommended for  Assessment of hip osteoarthritis  according to 2013 European League Against Rheumatism(EULAR) recommendations for the non-pharmacological core management of hip and knee osteoarthritis What is the level of recommendtaion strength and level of evidence.","Short_answer":"Biopsychosocial initial assessments is Recommend for hip osteoarthritis Assessment.

In patients with hip and\/or knee OA, water-based exercise was found to significantly reduce pain (ES, 95% CI 0.19, 0.04 to 0.35) and improve function (ES, 95% CI 0.26, 0.11 to 0.42) compared with education, telephone calls or no intervention. Home-based exercise was found to be as effective as water based exercise in one small RCT in people with hip OA. Water-based exercise can include swimming and\/or different types of exercise programmes. Since the different modes of delivery are equally effective, the person’s preference, findings of the initial assessment and local availability should determine the choice of mode of delivery in clinical practice. The literature suggests that pacing of activity and\/or integrating physical activity into daily living as part of a comprehensive exercise regimen is more effective in people with hip or knee OA or with knee pain than usual care or written information, but not compared with standardised exercise or a pharmacy review.

The committee based their recommendations on the evidence and their experience. They agreed that it is important to tell people that diagnosis is made clinically without imaging, that imaging rarely provides any extra information helpful for diagnosing or planning non-surgical treatment for osteoarthritis, and that it would only be used if there were suspicion of an alternative diagnosis or other complications. This would help reassure and dispel any belief that X-rays or other forms of imaging are needed to diagnose osteoarthritis. \nThe committee noted the importance of information that offers hope for the future and supports self-management strategies (for example, information that emphasises symptom-reducing behaviours, like therapeutic exercise).

However, for people with knee osteoarthritis, the evidence generally showed that as more weight was lost, the benefits for quality of life, pain and physical function increased. The committee acknowledged the challenges people can have with losing weight and maintaining this weight loss, and recommended that they are supported. \nThe committee acknowledged that, for people who are overweight, losing more than 10% of their body weight may be the most beneficial, but this may not be achievable for all.

They agreed that also explaining that losing 10% of their body weight is likely to be better than 5% might help provide an incentive and encourage weight loss. They also agreed that advising on the amount of weight to lose can help people with osteoarthritis by providing a target for them to work towards. The committee determined that, although evidence was from people with knee osteoarthritis, this could be applied to people with other osteoarthritis-affected joints. This is because of the potential additional benefits of weight loss seen in other populations, such as reducing inflammatory factors, that may be beneficial for all joint sites and general wellbeing.

Therefore, the committee used their expertise to inform the recommendation. They acknowledged that imaging was important for confirming the severity of structural joint changes when planning or considering surgery. But it was unclear who should do this imaging because some surgeons may only accept a referral for surgery if they are provided with imaging results, whereas others may prefer to do their own imaging after referral. However, in most cases, imaging should not be needed for managing osteoarthritis because it does not guide how the condition will respond to treatment.

The strength of recommendation is Strong The certainty of evidence is Not specified. According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)\n\nAlthough lateral heel wedges had historical support for their use in knee arthritis, contemporary studies have not shown a reliable improvement in pain relief, and no contemporary studies have shown sufficient functional improvement for patients suffering from knee arthritis to recommend using lateral wedge insoles. Lateral heel wedges can be prepared as an insert for the heel alone, or included in the heel of an independent arch support (i.e. lateral heel wedge arch support of LWAS) or built into the shoe itself (as was used by Hinman et al 2016). In the arthritic knee, medial compartment compression forces are commonly increased, especially in the knee with varus tibiofemoral alignment. The knee adduction moment can be calculated by gait analysis. The lateral wedge is thought to change the knee adduction moment thus relieving medial compartment pressure, hence relieving arthritic pain.\n\nOur literature review screening culled several papers for analysis. Baker and Goggins 2007 was a high-quality study finding no important differences between insole and wedged insole. 90 patients were randomized to one treatment for 6 weeks followed by a 4-week washout period and then the opposite treatment. There were no major differences in pain during either phase of the study. More musculoskeletal symptoms and more blisters occurred with neutral insoles. No patient falls were attributed to the treatment alternatives.\n\nFelson and Parke 2019 prescreened patients to eliminate those with patellofemoral OA and biomechanical non-responders. Lateral wedge insoles reduced knee pain, but the effect of treatment was small and was considered likely of clinical significance in only a minority of patients. 21 of 83 of patients did not show sufficient biomechanical correction. Only 28% of patients in the active phase of treatment had minimally important improvement whereas 22% of patients wearing neutral insoles reached the same level of improvement. 2 patients stopped treatment while wearing lateral wedge insoles (calf pain at night and increased knee pain) and 2 stopped while wearing neutral insoles (toe blister and increased knee pain). They also looked at volume of arthritic bone marrow lesions (BML) found by MRI and saw no significant difference in BML change between study and control groups.\n\nIn Bennell 2011, 89 patients with mild to moderate knee arthritis completed follow up with lateral insoles worn daily for 12 months. 90 patients completed follow up as the control group wearing neutral insoles. Pain relief after 12 months showed no significant difference between the groups.\n\nIn Hsieh 2016, 90 patients with Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 or higher radiographic changes were randomized to either a rigid insole with lateral wedge arch support (LWAS) or a soft insole with lateral wedge. Dropout rate was 20% with rigid and 15.6% with soft insoles over the 3-month long study. They concluded that patients using the soft insole LWAS had improved pain and function. However, their primary data suggests better walking time and speed going up and down stairs with rigid LWAS.\n\nFurthermore, pain was improved with soft LWAS only at the 3-month mark. Authors suggested longer-term follow-up for soft insoles.\n\nHinman 2016 evaluated an unloading shoe with stiff lateral midsole and 5-degree lateral wedge insole in comparison to a standard walking shoe. 164 patients were enrolled with 96% retention during the 6 months study. 83 patients received the unloading shoes and the control shoes. 14 of 83 stopped wearing the unloading shoes for various reasons and 8 of 81 stopped wearing the control shoes. 160 completed primary outcome measures at 6 months. There was no significant difference between groups with regard to pain or function, although both groups did show improvement.\n\n20% of participants with the study shoes reported ankle and foot pain whereas 9% of control shoe participants did so. There was no difference in the reason to discontinue treatment (unloading shoe 4% versus 2% control). Other reported adverse events were back pain, hip pain, knee pain, knee stiffness\/swelling, and shin\/calf pain. 2 of 83 experimental group patients reported an increase in knee pain with the unloading shoe and 2 of 81 control patients reported that the conventional shoe did not relieve knee pain.\n\nToda 2004 followed 84 knee female arthritis patients were followed for one month wearing either a hard rubber insole or urethane insole secured to the foot with a subtalar strap used for ankle sprains. 12 mm lateral wedge was manufactured for both. 17 of the 42 rubber insole patients had complications (foot pain in 8; popliteal pain in 6; low back pain in 3) versus 8 of the 42 using urethane insoles (popliteal pain in 4; foot pain in 3; low back pain in 1). All patients improved by the Lequesne Index with the urethane group achieving statistically significant improvement.\n\nNiazi 2014 was a comparison of off-loading knee brace versus lateral wedge insole. 120 patients with both radiographic medial compartment arthritis and gene varum were randomized to either knee brace or lateral wedge insole. Pain improvement with the knee brace group was statistically significant compared to the lateral wedge insole, but clinically minor (VAS 3.97 in the study group compared to 4.53 in controls).\n\nIn Hatef 2013, 118 of 150 patients completed the 2-month long study (101 women and 17 men). Half were given LWAS, and the control group wore neutral insoles. Patient compliance was much worse in the LWAS group. They noted statistically significant decline in knee pain and EKFS in women in the LWAS, but not men. Overall, there was improvement in the LWAS group. There was a much higher non-compliance rate in the LWAS than with the neutral insoles with 29 of 57 patients stopping use of the insoles by weeks 5 to 6 of an 8-week study.\n\nWe identified one potential study within our literature which addressed the question of special shoe versus a conventional shoe. Nigg 2006 evaluated a training shoe which purports to convert a flat hard surface into “natural uneven ground”, thus prompting increased muscle activity in the lower extremity. The control shoe was a standard walking shoe. 58 patients were enrolled in the study group and 67 in the control group. Both groups had one patient drop out (cumbersome shoes in the study group and increased knee pain with the control shoe). Pain with walking was improved at 12 weeks in both groups, without between groups difference. The study shoe showed increased pain relief at 3, 6, and 12 weeks. The control shoe showed increased pain relief at 3 and 12 weeks. They also reported improved balance from baseline in the study shoe at 12 weeks, which was not statistically significant.","Source":"2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)","Location":"knee","Intervention":"Lateral wedge insoles","Type of recommendation":"Not Recommend","Strength of recommendation":"Strong","Certainty of evidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline_Specific_Question":"Is Canes recommended for Physical Treatment of knee osteoarthritis  according to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty) What is the level of recommendtaion strength and level of evidence.","Short_answer":"Canes is Recommend for knee osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment.

With that in mind, only a small number of modern studies have formally investigated use of a cane for knee osteoarthritis. Our literature review found one high-quality study (Jones 2012) showing support for use regarding moderate pain relief and another study (Van Ginckel 2019) of moderate quality showing no major improvement in pain.\n\nJones 2012 performed a comprehensive study of use of a cane for knee osteoarthritis. Their primary outcome was pain, but they also looked at function, general health, consumption of NSAIDs, and energy expenditure. 64 patients were selected out of a total of 323 patients nominated from a rheumatology clinic. The majority of possible patients (168 out of 323) refused to participate in the study. 32 patients were randomized to use of a cane for 60 days (EG, experimental group). The cane was cut to appropriate height, and they received instructions on its use. The 32 control patients (CG) were instructed to maintain a normal lifestyle and not to use auxiliary gait devices. At 30 and 60 days, the EG patients had less pain compared to controls. The greatest improvement was in the VAS (10 cm scale): EG averaging 3.84 cm and CG 5.95 cm at 60 days. The Lequesne scale (0-24) difference was only 2.53 (CG 15.09 and EG 12.56 at 60 days). At 60 days, the study group consumed fewer NSAIDs than control.\n\nVan Ginckel 2019 evaluated use of a cane in patients with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis and bone marrow lesions (BML) on MRI. The primary intent of their study was to identify an effect on the size of BML by using a cane. Out of 1989 potential patients (contacted by phone or online) 231 were considered eligible for radiographic screening and of those, only 79 showed arthritic changes on plain films and BML on MRI and chose to continue with the study. 40 patients were assigned to use a cane whenever walking for the next 12 weeks. 39 control patients were instructed to maintain their usual lifestyle without any gait aids. Only one patient in the control group was lost to follow up. After 3 months, there was no significant improvement in BML size. Secondary information was obtained relative to clinical characteristics. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regards to knee pain (WOMAC scale) or quality of life (AQoL 6-D scale) although there was improvement in global knee pain in the group using the cane.","Source":"2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)","Location":"knee","Intervention":"Canes","Type of recommendation":"Recommend","Strength of recommendation":"moderate","Certainty of evidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline_Specific_Question":"Is Brace treatment recommended for Physical Treatment of knee osteoarthritis  according to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty) What is the level of recommendtaion strength and level of evidence.","Short_answer":"Brace treatment is Recommend for knee osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment.

Three prospective randomized controlled trials compared bracing to control groups for treatment of symptomatic OA of the knee joint and found statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in patient symptoms related to symptomatic OA of the knee (Callaghan 2015; Thoumie 2018; Brouwer 2006b). Kirkley et al compared outcomes between valgus offloading brace, neoprene sleeve, and non-brace control for symptomatic OA and Varus alignment. This study reported statistically significant improvement in disease-specific quality of life and function in both study groups (Kirkley 1999). The study by Brouwer et al., comparing valgus bracing to a non-braced control, and reported no significant difference in functional assessment, PRO or pain; however, clinically significant improvements were noted in walking distance (1.25km[0.15,2.35]) for the brace group.

Callaghan et al examined the effects of bracing for patella-femoral OA and found significant improvement from baseline VAS and KOOS pain scores.

According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)\n\nTen high-quality studies were reviewed that compared a supervised exercise program to a non-exercise control (e.g., no treatment, heat only, education, usual primary care). (Christensen 2015, Holsgaard-Larsen 2018, Oliveira 2012, Willamson 2007, de Rooij 2017, Imoto 2012, Topp 2002, Hu 2020, Kim 2013, Chen 2014) Seven of these studies found greater improvements in pain, function, or both pain and function over the non-exercise control group (Oliveira 2012, de Rooij 2017, Imoto 2012, Topp 2002, Hu 2020, Kim 2013, Chen 2014).\n\nOne high-quality study and four moderate-quality studies were reviewed that compared supervised exercise to a non-supervised exercise program (e.g., home program, internet-based program, exercise brochure). (McCarthy 2004, Allen 2018, Yilmaz 2019, Tunay 2010, Bennell 2014). Patients from both groups received benefit from the interventions but there were mixed results as to whether supervised exercise was superior to the non-supervised exercise programs. It appears that both supervised or non-supervised exercise programs can result in improved pain and function in people with knee osteoarthritis.\n\nFour high-quality studies and one moderate-quality study were reviewed that compared aquatic exercise to either usual primary care, education, or self-management. (Kuptniratsaikul 2019, Rewald 2020, Waller 2017, Munukka 2020, Dias 2017.) Three high-quality studies reported greater improvements in pain, function, or global ratings of improvement for the aquatic groups over the control groups. (Kuptniratsaikul 2019, Rewald 2020, Dias 2017) One high-quality study reported increased leisure time activity for the aquatic group compared to the control. (Waller 2017) One moderate-quality study compared aquatic exercise to land-based exercise. (Silva 2008) There was no difference in WOMAC pain and function scores reported between groups for this study, but the aquatic exercise group had less pain with walking compared to the land-based group. Although there may be some benefit from aquatic exercise, inconsistent results do not allow us to recommend aquatic exercise over land-based exercise at this time.\n\nSeveral studies examined clinical outcomes for different modes of exercise in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Ebnezar 2012 reported some improvement in anxiety measures when comparing yoga to non-yoga exercise. (Ebnezar 2012) Other studies compared weightbearing to non-weightbearing exercise (Bennell 2020, Jan 2009), high versus low resistance training (Jan 2008), isokinetic, isometric, and isotonic exercise (Huang 2005), and leg versus hip exercise (Lun 2015) and did not find substantial differences in the mode of exercise.

They typically include several sessions over several weeks. These programs train people in several elements of self-management for osteoarthritis including medication compliance, pain management and pain coping strategies, joint protection strategies during physical activity, exercise advice, problem-solving approaches, and stress management techniques.\n\nFour high-quality studies (Saffari 2018, Somers 2012, Hurley 2007, Omidi 2018) and one moderate-quality study (Coleman 2012) compared self-management to usual care or no treatment. These studies reported greater improvements in pain, function, or both compared to the control groups. In addition, some of these studies reported greater improvements in quality of life, pain catastrophizing, and self-efficacy in the self-management groups (Saffari 2018, Somers 2012).\n\nOne high-quality study (Marconcin 2018) and three moderate-quality studies examined the combined use of self-management and exercise to either groups that received self-management or exercise alone (Bennell 2016) or usual care (Yip 2007, Kao 2012). Yip et al. reported greater improvements in pain, time spent in leisure activities, and self-efficacy, compared to usual care. (Yip 2007) reported greater improvements in pain and function compared to the control groups. Bennell, et al, reported improvements in pain and function in all groups. There were no differences between groups on pain measures but the combined use of self-management (i.e., pain coping skills training) and exercise had greater improvements in function compared to those receiving only self-management or exercise (Bennell 2016).\n\nAn attempt was made to examine the literature on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in the management of people with knee osteoarthritis. One high-quality study (Helminen 2015) and 4 moderate-quality (Focht 2012, Focht 2017, Smith 2015, Lerman 2017) studies were reviewed. Control groups consisted of usual care (Helminen 2015), traditional exercise approaches for knee osteoarthritis (Focht 2012, Focht 2017), or behavioral desensitization (Smith 2015, Lerman 2017). Inconsistency in outcome results across studies made it difficult to provide a recommendation for this intervention approach at this time.","Source":"2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)","Location":"knee","Intervention":"Self- management programs","Type of recommendation":"Recommend","Strength of recommendation":"Strong","Certainty of evidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline_Specific_Question":"Is Patient education programs recommended for Education Treatment of knee osteoarthritis  according to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty) What is the level of recommendtaion strength and level of evidence.","Short_answer":"Patient education programs is Recommend for knee osteoarthritis EducationTreatment.

These studies reported more significant improvements in pain compared to the control groups.\n\nPatient education programs in studies overlap with self-management programs. Patient education programs vary from patient handout, 2+ hour DVD, one-day education to multiple sessions over a month (Saffari 2018, Cagnin 2019, Brosseau 2012, O’Brien 2018, Rezende 2017, Rodriguez da Silva 2017, Rini 2015). Many studies are challenging to evaluate the effects of education because they involve exercise classes and other proven interventions (Marra 2012, Ravaud 2009). Self-management programs train people in several elements of self-management for osteoarthritis (1148), including medication compliance, pain management, and pain coping strategies, joint protection strategies (1149) during physical activity, exercise advice, problem-solving approaches, and stress management techniques. Patient education programs may not be as labor-intensive, and further work is needed to identify the amount of education needed to improve patient-related outcome measures, like pain.\n\nPrograms that focused on education are two high quality (Saffari 2018, Cagnin 2019) and four moderate quality (Brosseau 2012, O’Brien 2018, Rodriguez da Silva 2017, Rini 2015). Saffari used seven (7) group sessions over one month and provided a CD-ROM and booklet describing preventive lifestyle procedures and the importance of treatment adherence (Saffari 2018). They found improvement in SF-12 and pain scores. Cagnin used an educational session with a physical therapist who demonstrated how recommended exercises should be performed and how patients can manage their pain. They demonstrated improvement in KOOS pain scores (Cagnin 2019). Brousseau looked at education (educational pamphlet) vs. walking and education vs. walking and behavioral intervention (Brouseau 2012). There was a non-clinically significant improvement in pain in the education-only group at 12 months compared to walking and behavioral intervention. O’Brien used weight loss education, where trained telephone interviewers provided brief advice and education about the benefits of weight loss and physical activity for knee osteoarthritis immediately after randomization [O’Brien 2018]. The intervention group provided an evidence-based public health non-disease-specific telephone-based coaching service funded by the local Australian state government to support adults in making sustained lifestyle improvements, including diet, physical activity, and achieving a healthy weight and, where appropriate, access smoking cessation services. They did not find an added benefit from the coaching service over the brief telephone education in pain nor WOMAC scores. Rini compared an internet-based app (PainCoach) [http:\/\/tri.ad\/projects-2\/] to usual care and found a non-clinically significant reduction in VAS pain scores (Rini 2015). Rodriguez da Silva used a single day (Saturday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.), which included seven lectures of 30 min by each professional team, and 60-min workshops by the physical education, physical therapy, and occupational therapy professionals, approaching the importance of their area in knee OA treatment\/management. The study did not report pain scores but did note an increase in mobility with improvements in the get-up and go test. The two high-quality and four moderate-quality studies showed improved pain scores from the education given during educational sessions. Most studies (15 of the 21) incorporate education with other interventions; therefore, it is impossible to isolate the effects of education in these other 15 studies.\n\nOne high quality (Gilbert 2018) and three moderate quality (Rezende 2017, Chen 202, Ravaud 2009) used the transtheoretical model (TTM) and motivational interviewing to improve osteoarthritis treatment adherence. These studies showed improvement in WOMAC pain scores. TTM has been used successfully in other conditions that benefit from lifestyle changes [PMID: 24500864].","Source":"2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)","Location":"knee","Intervention":"Patient education programs","Type of recommendation":"Recommend","Strength of recommendation":"Strong","Certainty of evidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline_Specific_Question":"Is Sustained weight loss recommended for Other Treatment of knee osteoarthritis  according to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty) What is the level of recommendtaion strength and level of evidence.","Short_answer":"Sustained weight loss is Recommend for knee osteoarthritis OtherTreatment.

According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)\nSustained weight loss is recommended to improve pain and function in overweight and obese patients with knee osteoarthritis.\nThere were 1 high (Jenkinson et. al 2009), 1 moderate (Miller 2006), and 2 low strength (Focht 2005, Rejeski 2002) studies evaluating diet and exercise as weight loss interventions to treat knee osteoarthritis. Overall pain and function improved with weight loss achieved through a combination of diet and exercise. However, when evaluating only diet vs control, 2 high (Bliddal 2011, Christensen 2015), 2 moderate (Messier 2013, Mihalko 2018) and 2 low strength (Rejeski 2002, Fochyt 2005) there was no clear clinically significant change in patient outcomes. Specifically, Christensen et al, 2015 published a high-quality study investigating the effect of weight on symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. They showed no significant difference in pain and function at 1 year. Bliddal et al, 2010 published another high-quality study which investigated the effect of weight loss on symptoms of knee OA in the obese patient, showing that perceived pain (via WOMAC) was significantly lessened despite not being able to show improvement in function and quality of life at 1 year.\n\nThere were 2 moderate strength studies (Messier 2013, Mihalko 2018) which evaluated diet vs exercise, which favored exercises. To note, Messier et al 2013 published results of the IDEA trial with moderate quality study which was an attempt to determine if a 10% reduction in body weight (induced by diet, with or without exercise) would improve “clinical and mechanistic” outcomes in sedentary lifestyle patients (BMI 27 thru 41). Interestingly, in this primary study, they were unable to show an improvement in WOMAC pain but they did show improvement in the WOMAC function subscale, and also showed improvements in the 6-minute walk test.\n\nGiven the current evidence, it is at the discretion of the surgeon as to which approach is utilized to address weight loss, however a combination of diet and exercises appears to be the preferred alternative.\n\nThe Weight Loss Intervention recommendation has been downgraded one level because of inconsistent evidence.","Source":"2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)","Location":"knee","Intervention":"Sustained weight loss","Type of recommendation":"Recommend","Strength of recommendation":"moderate","Certainty of evidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline_Specific_Question":"Is Manual therapy in addition to an exercise program recommended for Physical Treatment of knee osteoarthritis  according to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty) What is the level of recommendtaion strength and level of evidence.","Short_answer":"Manual therapy in addition to an exercise program is may be used for knee osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment.

Control groups consisted of either no acupuncture (Hinman 2014), sham acupuncture (Mavrommatis 2012, Suarez-Almazor 2010, Vas 2007, Berman 2004), sham TENS (Chen 2013), or usual care (Berman 1999). The meta-analysis also accounted for the degree of blinding effectiveness of the studies. The results of the meta-analysis can be seen in Figure 11 in the appendix. The overall findings were in favor of acupuncture for reducing pain in subjects with knee osteoarthritis. There appeared to be no effect in two studies where blinding was effective. In studies where there was no blinding or the effects of blinding were unclear, there were greater effects favoring acupuncture. This prompted our decision to apply a limited strength of recommendation in favor of acupuncture for pain control.\n\nA similar meta-analysis was performed using the same studies for measures of function. The results of this meta-analysis can be seen in Figure 12 in the appendix. The overall findings were in favor of acupuncture for improving measures of function in subjects with knee osteoarthritis. However, the effects of blinding effectiveness on the results were similar to that described above for pain. Again, this prompted our decision to apply a limited strength of recommendation in favor of acupuncture for improving function.\n\nSome investigators examined variations in the delivery of acupuncture treatment. Ju et al. examined high intensity vs. low intensity electro-acupuncture and found no difference between these approaches for pain but possibly better improvements in function favoring the high-intensity group (Ju 2015). Others found no meaningful differences between using 2-point, 4-point, or 6-point acupuncture approaches (Qi 2016, Taechaarpornkul 2009).\n\nThe Acupuncture recommendation has been downgraded two levels because of inconsistent evidence and a lack of internal consistency with recommendations of equal supporting evidence.","Source":"2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)","Location":"knee","Intervention":"Acupuncture","Type of recommendation":"may be used","Strength of recommendation":"limited","Certainty of evidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline_Specific_Question":"Is Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation recommended for Physical Treatment of knee osteoarthritis  according to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty) What is the level of recommendtaion strength and level of evidence.","Short_answer":"Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation is may be used for knee osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment.

According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)\nOral NSAIDs are recommended to improve pain and function in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis when not contraindicated.\nAmong the 34 high-quality, 23 moderate-quality, and 1 low-quality studies that met the inclusion criteria, non-selective and selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) consistently improved pain and function compared to controls in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee (Reginster 2017; Lee 2017; Gordo 2017; Strand 2017; Essex 2014; Kongtharvonskul 2016; Altman 2015; Gibofsky 2014; Ishijima 2014; Conaghan 2013; Essex 2012; Singh 2012; Elsaman 2016; Schnitzer 2011; Kivitz 2004; Fleischmann 1997; Lee 1986; Davies 1999; Sandelin 1997; Puopolo 2007; Gibofsky 2003; Bensen 1999; Kivits 2002; Clegg 2006; Sangdee 2002; Sheldon 2005; Tannenbaum 2004; Lehmann 2005; Rother 2007; Simon 2009; Svensson 2006; Schnitzer 2010; Doherty 2011; McKenna 2001 (a); Paul 2009; Bolten 2015; Essex 2015; Ekman 2014; Ohtori 2013; Selvan 2012; Pavelka 2007; Ehrich 1999; Lee 1985; Dwicandra 2018; Asmus 2014; Smugar 2006; Bingham 2007; Altman 1998; Schnitzer 1999; Birbara 2006; Williams 2001; Miceli 2004; Mckenna 2001 (b); Pincus 2004; Lohmander 2005; Schnitzer 2005b; Williams 2000; Fleischmann 2006). Although meta-analysis of non-selective oral NSAIDs compared to controls demonstrated a meaningful reduction in pain, the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively high degree of heterogeneity. The meta-analysis of non-selective oral NSAIDs compared to controls demonstrated a meaningful improvement in function with an acceptable degree of heterogeneity. In terms of selective COX-2 oral NSAIDs, the meta-analysis of celecoxib, the only available selective COX-2 oral NSAID on the United States market, demonstrated a meaningful reduction in pain and improved function with an acceptable degree of heterogeneity. The comparison of non-selective and selective COX-2 oral NSAIDs shows no significant difference in the effectiveness between the types of oral NSAIDs (Gordo 2017; Essex 2014; Essex 2016; Essex 2012; Bensen 1999; Kivits 2002; Kivitz 2004; Puopolo 2007; Hochberg 2011; McKenna 2001 (b); Schnitzer 2005b; Malik 2017). Although NSAIDs effectively reduce pain and improve function in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, providers should consider patient comorbidities, the type of NSAID administered, dose, and duration of administration. In fact, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a black-box warning for NSAIDs citing an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events and serious gastrointestinal events. Therefore, we recommend the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible for the patient. Although selective COX-2 oral NSAIDs were developed to reduce gastrointestinal adverse events compared to non-selective oral NSAIDs, meta-analysis did not reveal a significant reduction in gastrointestinal adverse events.","Source":"2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)","Location":"knee","Intervention":"Oral NSAIDs","Type of recommendation":"Recommend","Strength of recommendation":"Strong","Certainty of evidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline_Specific_Question":"Is Oral acetaminophen  recommended for Pharmacological Treatment of knee osteoarthritis  according to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty) What is the level of recommendtaion strength and level of evidence.","Short_answer":"Oral acetaminophen  is Recommend for knee osteoarthritis PharmacologicalTreatment.

A comparison of patients from these studies and from studies validating the MCIDs were used to judge clinical significance. Results revealed that patients were demographically comparable for WOMAC and VAS pain as well as WOMAC function based on age, baseline pain scores, BMI, weight, and gender. Meta-analysis in meaningfully important difference (MID) units showed that the effect was less than 0.5 MID units, indicating a low likelihood that an appreciable number of patients achieved clinically important benefits after intraarticular HA injection (Guyatt et al.). When we differentiated high- versus low-molecular weight viscosupplementation (three high, two moderate and two low quality studies), our analyses demonstrated no significant differences among different viscosupplementation formulations. Crosslinking features of the viscosupplemtation product was assessed in two high quality studies. In patients with OA, there was no difference between cross-linked and non-cross-linked HA.\n\nSome studies demonstrated a statistical benefit with the use of HA but could not reach the significance for a minimally clinical meaningful difference, leading to the conclusion that viscosupplementation can represent a viable option for some patients that failed other treatments when appropriately indicated. The number needed to treat to see a tangible benefit from HA was 17 patients. Furthermore, this difference was most evident at 6 weeks and 3 months. Most of the studies that exist in the literature evaluate low to moderate arthritic knees (Kellgren Lawrence of I-III) with worse results in patients with severely affected knees (KL IV).\n\nThe 2013 edition of this guideline strongly recommended against the use of viscosupplementation. In contrast to this updated version, the 2021 version found that statistically significant improvements were associated with high-molecular cross-linked hyaluronic acid but when compared to mid-range molecular weight, statistical significance was not maintained.

There were mixed results in the studies for pain and function. A meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity. Two studies (Akan; 2018, Gormeli; 2017) looked at PRP in severe OA with mixed results. Two studies (Rayegani; 2014, Gormeli; 2017) looked at change in all stages of OA at a six-month timeframe. The studies had mixed results. One study (Gormeli; 2017) looked at Kellgren-Lawrence 1-3 stage OA with improvement in IKDC and EQ-VAS. Therefore, due to the heterogeneity of results and the difference in early and late stage OA results, we downgraded the recommendation to Limited from Strong. We feel these recommendations may change with future research on the use of PRP in different levels of severity of OA.\n\nThe number of PRP injections had mixed results with the studies with three PRP injections (Akan; 2018, Gormeli; 2017) having positive results outcomes for pain and function. Studies with one and two PRP injections had mixed results, with the positive being less likely clinically significant changes in pain and function. Further research should be done to determine the number of PRP injections for treatment of KOA. Currently, three IA-PRP injections appear to have more favorable results.\n\nAdverse events from PRP injections have been investigated in one high-quality study (Huang; 2018) reported adverse events for PRP vs. control. They reported hypertension and proteinuria were treatment-related side-effects. These met Common Toxicity Criteria grade ≥3. This raises questions on the safety of PRP, which needs further evaluation. Therefore, the strength of recommendation was downgraded to Limited.\n\nWhen evaluating the effectiveness of PRP vs HA, there were eight high-quality studies (Sanchez; 2012, Vaquerizo; 2013, Filardo; 2015, Gormeli; 2017, Cole; 2017, Buendia-Lopez; 2018, Di Martino; 2019, Yaradilmis; 2020) and six (6) medium-quality studies (Spakova; 2012, Raeissadat; 2015, Lana; 2016, Duymus; 2017, Raeissadat; 2017, Ahmad; 2018) and one low-quality study (Sanchez; 2008) that investigated IA-PRP vs. IA-HA. Four studies were included in a meta-analysis of Total WOMAC results at the 9- OR 12-months mark. This analysis showed a clinically significant difference for IA-PRP over IA-HA. The results between IA-PRP vs IA-HA diverged after 6 months. Most studies showed similar results between IA-PRP and IA-HA at six months, except one (Yaradilimis 2020) where the LR-PRP total WOMAC was better at all time points than the IA HA. Both the patients in the IA HA and IA PRP improved in total WOMAC at six months. Patients in the IA-PRP-arms maintained improvement after 6 months at the 9- OR 12-months mark for total WOMAC vs. IA-HA which started to have a worsening score. The standard is to inject IA-HA every six months in patients with painful KOA. The preparation of the PRP (LR-PRP vs LP-PRP) was noted to be different with the LR-PRP had higher MID values than LP-PRP vs. IA-HA. The research highlights the prolonged effect of IA-PRP over IA-HA, though both appear to be equivalent at 6 months.\nPatient-related outcome measures (OARSI-OMERACT responders, percentage of subjects meeting a percentage reduction in VAS Pain OR WOMAC Pain scores) (Sanchez; 2008, Sanchez; 2012, Vaquerizo; 2013, Buendia-Lopez; 2018) more often favored IA-PRP at both the six-month and 12-month time frame. Further research is needed using standardized PROMs to investigate the effectiveness of IA-PRP to determine if more patients will benefit from IA-PRP at six months over IA-HA.\n\nAdverse events were higher in the PRP group than IA HA, both local soreness and injection pain (two studies (Spakova; 2012, Yaradilmis; 2020)) and one study (Huang; 2018) reported systemic events (proteinuria and hypertension). One study (Vaquerizo; 2013) did not find a difference in comparing any adverse event, and one study (Raeissadat; 2017) did not see a difference for minor injection-site adverse events. Therefore, there appears to be more studies finding IA-PRP to have more adverse events vs. IA-HA, more research is needed to determine if the adverse events outweigh the benefit of IA-PRP over IA-HA at 9 and 12 months. This is another reason for the downgrade in evidence from Strong to Limited.\n\nComparisons between IA-PRP and IA-CS, there were three high (Joshi Juber; 2017, Khan; 2018, Nabi; 2018) and one moderate quality study (Huang; 2019). One study (Joshi Juber; 2017) was KL IV end-stage OA and did not find a difference. One study (Khan; 2018) was repeat injections every other month (0, 2, 4 months) with follow up at six months in KL II OAK with no difference. One study (Nabi; 2018) used patients with KL II-III given three injections one month apart showed improvement at three months (one month after the last injection) and six months (4 months after the final injection). One study (Huang; 2019) did three PRP injections every three weeks on KL I-II OAK showed improvement in pain and function at six months (4 months after last injection) and 12 months (10 months after last injection). Therefore, the IA-PRP given in three injections evaluated at 4 months post last injection is more likely to show benefit in KL II and III stages of KOA. More research is needed to evaluate long-term benefits of IA-PRP vs IA-CS over a two- or five-year period to determine if IA-PRP is cartilage sparing vs IA-CS concern for possible cartilage damage over time.\n\nPRP is defined in LR-PRP and LP-PRP. There may be a difference in the effectiveness in knee osteoarthritis between these two preparations. Currently, there is limited data from one direct comparison (Yaradilimis; 2020) and our meta-analysis (Figure 45) of IA-PRP and IA-HA that would demonstrate that intra-articular LR-PRP vs. LP-PRP for KOA is more likely to demonstrate a benefit at 9 and 12 months.

There was one high strength (Moseley et al 2002), two moderate strength (Kirkley et al. 2008, Kalunian et al. 2000), and one low quality (Saeed et al. 2015).\n\nKirkely et al. 2008 compared arthroscopic surgery which included lavage and debridement combined with physical therapy and medical treatment versus physical therapy and medical treatment alone. The outcome measures utilized were the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, Short Form-36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary score, McMaster– Toronto Arthritis Patient Preference Disability Questionnaire (MACTAR), and the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) and standard-gamble utility scores. Six patients assigned to surgery elected not to have the procedure; data from these patients were analyzed, according to the intention to- treat principle, with data from the surgery group. Out of all potential outcomes, only two were statistically significant in favor of surgery. In summary, this randomized controlled trial demonstrated no benefit of arthroscopic lavage and debridement compared to physical therapy and medical treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\nKalunian et al. 2000 compared arthroscopic lavage (3000ml) with placebo (250ml). The study was performed at 4 different institutes and included a large number of enrolled patients from one institution with intra-articular crystals in their knee. The arthroscopes used were less than usual caliber in size ranging from 1.7mm to 2.7mm. Outcome measures were WOMAC scores at 12 months. There were not any statistically significant differences in aggregate WOMAC scores between the two treatment groups. The study concludes that irrigation may be helpful in a small subset of patients, especially those with crystals.\n\nMosley et al. 2002 study is an RCT comparing arthroscopic debridement, arthroscopic lavage, versus placebo \/ sham surgery. The study provides strong evidence that knee arthroscopy with or without debridement is not better and appears to be equivalent to a placebo procedure in improving knee pain and self-reported function. However, the study raised questions regarding its limited sampling (mostly male veterans) as well as the number of potential study participants who declined randomization into a treatment group. They also used a non-validated Knee Specific Pain score. Also, patients with substantial malalignment (varus or valgus deformity) and those with advanced disease, who might have a poorer response to surgical intervention were included in the trial.\n\nSaeed et al. 2015 compared HA injections versus arthroscopic debridement in patients with OA in an RCT where only the pain component of the knee society score was utilized. In the short-term follow-up of 6 months, arthroscopy failed to show better pain outcome than injections.\n\nMost of the studies excluded patients with meniscal tear, loose body, or other mechanical derangement, with concomitant diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee.

According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)\n\nThe three studies discussed below compare outcomes following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy with physical therapy and demonstrate that knee arthroscopy with partial meniscectomy is as effective as physical therapy. In PICO 5, this workgroup recommended supervised or unsupervised exercise as opposed to no exercise to improve pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Currently, there are no studies that compare outcomes (knee pain and function) following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy versus physical therapy alone in patients who have failed to improve with an initial course of physical therapy. It is important to clearly define the appropriate indications for arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in patients with knee OA. This procedure should be considered in patients with mild-to-moderate knee OA and an MRI-confirmed meniscal tear who have previously failed appropriate conservative treatment such as physical therapy, corticosteroid injections, and a course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.\n\nKatz et al (2013) conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of symptomatic patients over the age 45 or older with a meniscal tear and evidence of mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis to determine the efficacy of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy compared to standardized physical therapy in this patient population. Three hundred fifty-one patients were randomly assigned to surgery and postoperative physical therapy or to a standardized physical therapy regimen (with the option to cross over to surgery at the discretion of the patient and surgeon). The patients were evaluated at 6 and 12 months, and the primary outcome was the difference between the groups with respect to the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) physical function score. The mean improvement in WOMAC score at 6 months was similar between the groups. At 6 months, 51 patients who were randomized to physical therapy alone (30%) had undergone surgery. The authors concluded that in their intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences in functional improvement 6 months after randomization; however, 30% of patients in the physical therapy alone group underwent surgery. These patients were analyzed in their original group, based on the intention-to-treat analysis.\n\nVan de Graaf et al. (2018) performed a multicenter randomized clinical trial in the Netherlands to determine whether physical therapy is inferior to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) for improving patient-reported knee function in patients with meniscal tears. Three hundred twenty-one patients were randomly assigned to APM or a predefined physical therapy protocol. Patients were excluded if they had locking of the knee, prior knee surgery, instability caused by anterior or posterior cruciate ligament rupture, severe osteoarthritis (Kellgren Lawrence score of 4), and a BMI > 35 kg\/m2. Change in patient-reported knee function on the International Knee Documentation Committee Subscale Knee form (IKDC) over a 24-month period was used as the primary outcome. In the PT group, 47 patients (29%) had APM during the 24-month follow-up period. The authors noted a similar level of improvement in knee function between the APM and PT groups. They concluded that PT was noninferior to APM for improving patient-reported knee function over a 24-month follow-up period in patients with nonobstructive meniscal tears.\n\nIn 2007, Herrlin et al. performed a prospective randomized study to compare knee function and physical activity following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy followed by supervised exercise or supervised exercise alone in patients with non-traumatic medial meniscal tear. Ninety patients were evaluated using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS), the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, and Tegner Activity Scale and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain prior to the intervention and after 8 weeks of exercise and 6 months following intervention. The authors found that after the intervention, both groups reported decreased knee pain, improved knee function, and high satisfaction (p < 0.0001). They, therefore, concluded that arthroscopic partial meniscectomy was not superior to supervised exercise alone in terms of reduced knee pain, improved knee function, and improved quality of life.","Source":"2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)","Location":"knee","Intervention":"Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy","Type of recommendation":"Recommend","Strength of recommendation":"Moderate","Certainty of evidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline_Specific_Question":"Is High tibial osteotomy recommended for Surgery Treatment of knee osteoarthritis  according to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty) What is the level of recommendtaion strength and level of evidence.","Short_answer":"High tibial osteotomy is may be used for knee osteoarthritis SurgeryTreatment.

The strength of recommendation is Limited The certainty of evidence is Not specified. According to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)\nHigh tibial osteotomy may be considered to improve pain and function in properly indicated patients with unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis.\nHigh tibial osteotomy (HTO) has been used for pain relief of medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Realigning the varus knee provides mechanical decompression of the medial compartment. An osteotomy line is created in the proximal tibial, and either a wedge defect is created by opening the medial cortex and held open with a wedge or plate and screw hardware, or a lateral wedge is removed and secured commonly with staples or wires. In the Nerhus 2017 study, patients continued to show improvement 6 and 12 months post-operatively. Historical studies have reported pain reduction with survival rates approximately 70% at 10 years (“survival” usually interpreted with endpoint conversion to replacement) (van Outeren cites Brouwer 2014 and Niinimaki 2012).\n\nMany studies available for review by the workgroup compared various techniques of osteotomy in randomized studies. Ogawa 2019 found osteotomy distal to the tibial tubercle to be superior to proximal osteotomy for an opening wedge procedure with regard to patellofemoral pain. Arthroscopic evaluation of the knee joint at the time of osteotomy and second look at the time of hardware removal showed less patellar and trochlear degeneration with the distal osteotomy group.\n\nNerhus 2017 saw no significant functional difference between surgical patients randomized to either opening or closing wedge, with all showing improvement.\n\nDuivenvoorden 2014 reported improved HSS scores from 71 to 81 at 6 years post-op. VAS scores improved from 6.1 baseline to a statistically significant difference at follow up of 4.0 in the opening wedge patients and 3.2 with the closing wedge (albeit no statistical difference between the groups). It should be noted that patients lost to follow up started with a VAS score of 6.6, thus tempering the analysis of late results.\n\nBrouwer 2006 performed a prospective randomized trial comparing closing wedge and opening wedge techniques. Closing wedge was secured with two surgical staples and opening wedge with a Puddu plate. After one year, VAS score had improved from 6.1 to 3.6.\n\nVan Outeren 2017 is perhaps the closest attempt to a large randomized control trial between surgery and non-operative management. However, this is still not a highest quality randomized control trial. The researchers gathered two different groups of patients at two different hospitals. The first group underwent randomization to valgus bracing versus usual care. The second group was randomized to HTO with either an opening wedge or closing wedge osteotomy. The groups were matched for baseline characteristics. They found HTO more effective in pain reduction compared to non-operative methods. VAS changed from baseline 6.2 in the surgery group to 3.8 post-op. The control group improved from 6.4 to 5.0. Function was improved only in comparison of surgical patients to usual care treatment.\n\nThe Wu 2017 study evaluated people with bilateral OA with pain around the medial part of the knee. The more degenerative knee got proximal tibial osteotomy, and the other knee got usual non-operative care. The study authors included a table of individual patient data, which allowed a model that controlled for differences in baseline knee society function scores between the knees to be run. With this model, the odds ratio of achieving satisfactory knee society function scores (defined as score >= 80) with osteotomy vs. non-operative treatment was 7.51 (CI 1.094, 51.6).\n\nThe Tibial Osteotomy recommendation has been downgraded one level because of inconsistent evidence.","Source":"2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty)","Location":"knee","Intervention":"High tibial osteotomy","Type of recommendation":"may be used","Strength of recommendation":"Limited","Certainty of evidence":"Not specified"},{"Guideline_Specific_Question":"Is Dry needling recommended for Physical Treatment of knee osteoarthritis  according to 2021 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty) What is the level of recommendtaion strength and level of evidence.","Short_answer":"Dry needling is may be used for knee osteoarthritis PhysicalTreatment.
